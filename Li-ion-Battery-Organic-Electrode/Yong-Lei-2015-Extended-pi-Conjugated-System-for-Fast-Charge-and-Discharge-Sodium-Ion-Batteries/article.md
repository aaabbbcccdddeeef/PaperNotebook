### Abstract
Organic sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential alternatives of current commercial inorganic lithium-ion batteries for portable electronics (especially wearable electronics) because of their low cost and flexibility, making them possible to meet the future flexible and large-scale requirements. However, only a few organic SIBs have been reported so far, and most of them either were tested in a very slow rate or suffered significant performance degradation when cycled under high rate. Here, we are focusing on the molecular design for improving the battery performance and addressing the current challenge of fast-charge and -discharge. Through reasonable molecular design strategy, we demonstrate that the extension of the π-conjugated system is an efficient way to improve the high rate performance, leading to much enhanced capacity and cyclability with full recovery even after cycled under current density as high as 10 A g–1.  
有机钠离子电池（SIB）由于其低成本和高灵活性而成为当前用于便携式电子产品（尤其是可穿戴电子产品）的商用无机锂离子电池的潜在替代品，从而使其有可能满足未来的柔性和大规模需求。但是，到目前为止，仅报道了少数几种有机SIB，其中大多数要么以很慢的速率进行测试，要么以高速率循环时性能显着下降。在这里，我们专注于分子设计，以改善电池性能并解决当前快速充电和放电的挑战。通过合理的分子设计策略，我们证明了π共轭体系的扩展是一种提高高倍率性能的有效方法，即使在电流密度高达10 A g –1的条件下循环后，也可以大大提高容量和循环能力，并具有完全恢复的能力。

### Introduciton
Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have played an important role in power supply for portable electronic devices in the past two decades.(1-7) However, it meets a fatal challenge that the resources of lithium will run out in a few years. Researchers have found that rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising alternative candidates for the next-generation battery systems, based on much cheaper, nontoxic, and more abundant sodium-based materials. The reason is that sodium-based materials have similar electrochemical process with lithium-based materials and the electrochemical potential of sodium is similar to that of lithium (only 0.3 V more positive).(7-21) However, one challenge that the widely studied inorganic SIBs encounter is that the Na-ion is larger than Li-ion (diameter: 2.32 vs 1.80 Å), which may increase the difficulty of insertion/extraction of the Na-ions and even destroy the rigid structure of the materials. Besides, inorganic materials are limited resources and are always nondegradable. They usually need tedious synthesis and purification. Therefore, from a practical point of view, organic materials are more attractive alternatives for power supply especially in the future flexible and large-scale applications. This is due to the various advantages of organic materials: lightweight, flexibility, vast resources, solution processability, recyclability, and easily functionalized for improving the electrochemical performance.(1-4, 12-31) However, until now, only a few organic materials have been applied in SIBs.(12-21) Even worse, most of the previously reported organic SIBs were tested in a very slow charge/discharge process (e.g., 10 mA g–1, which takes a very long time for a charge/discharge cycle),(13-18) and those tested under fast charge/discharge process often led to significant performance degradation.(19-21) These naturally limit their potential applications.  
在过去的二十年中，可充电锂离子电池在便携式电子设备的电源供应中发挥了重要作用。（1-7）然而，锂的资源将在几年后耗尽，这是一个致命的挑战。研究人员发现，基于便宜得多，无毒且更丰富的钠基材料，可充电钠离子电池（SIB）是下一代电池系统最有希望的替代品之一。原因是钠基材料的电化学过程与锂基材料相似，并且钠的电化学势与锂相似（正电压仅高0.3 V）。（7-21）然而，这是一项被广泛研究的挑战无机SIB遇到的问题是Na离子比Li离子大（直径：2.32 vs 1.80Å），这可能会增加Na离子的插入/提取难度，甚至破坏材料的刚性结构。此外，无机材料是有限的资源，并且总是不可降解的。他们通常需要乏味的合成和纯化。因此，从实际的角度来看，有机材料是电源的更有吸引力的替代品，尤其是在未来的柔性和大规模应用中。这归因于有机材料的各种优势：轻巧，柔软，资源丰富，溶液可加工性，可回收性以及易于功能化以提高电化学性能。（1-4，12-31）然而，到目前为止，只有少数几种有机材料（12-21）更糟糕的是，大多数先前报道的有机SIB都是在非常慢的充电/放电过程中进行测试的（例如10 mA g–1，这需要很长时间才能充电） /放电周期），（13-18）和在快速充电/放电过程中测试的结果通常会导致性能显着下降。（19-21）这些自然限制了它们的潜在应用。

In order to achieve high rate performance, there is no doubt that three aspects are very critical, including the charge transport and collection, the stability of the charged and discharged states, and the ion diffusion. Inspired from the molecular design of organic semiconductors in organic electronics where the extended π-conjugated system can not only stabilize the +1 or −1 charged states but also facilitate the charge transport,(31) we herein focus on the molecular design, i.e., using the advantages of extended π-conjugated system for improving the battery performance and addressing the current challenge of fast-charge and -discharge. The extension of the π-conjugated system is predictable to be conducive to fast charge transport and collection and to improve the toleration to the fast insertion/extraction of Na-ions during the fast-charge and -discharge process. Simultaneously, extending the π-conjugated system is also helpful to strengthen the intermolecular interactions (e.g., π–π or C–H···π interactions) which might lead to a layer-by-layer molecular arrangement. This layer-by-layer molecular arrangement is expected to form a fast route for ion diffusion between two layers. In order to verify our assumption, the first and widely reported small molecule(29) for organic sodium batteries, sodium benzene-dicarboxylate (SBDC, Figure 1a),(17-19) is selected as starting molecule. In order to extend its π-conjugated system, three possible linkages, including carbon–carbon single, double, and triple bond, can be used to form extended π-conjugated molecules, giving molecule 1, SSDC (sodium 4,4′-stilbene-dicarboxylate), and 2 respectively (Figure 1a). The literatures have shown that the C–C single bond would lead to a nonplanar structure because of the steric hindrance between the adjacent aromatic rings,(16, 31-33) which unambiguously harms the extension of π-conjugation and thus impairs the charge transport and electric stability.(34-36) Similarly, due to its electron cloud shape and the possible rotation (also leading to nonplanar structure), the C≡C bond linked material possesses a lower π-conjugation than that of C═C bond based material as well.(31, 36, 37) Therefore, here, the carbon–carbon double bond is selected as the linkage to extend the π-conjugated system of SBDC. Considering the further increase in the molecular weight will decrease the specific capacity, SSDC, containing two benzene rings and offering a theoretical specific capacity of 172 mAh g–1, is designed as a model to investigate the influence of extended π-conjugated system on the fast-charge and -discharge sodium batteries.  
为了获得高速率性能，毫无疑问，三个方面非常关键，包括电荷传输和收集，充电和放电状态的稳定性以及离子扩散。受到有机电子学中有机半导体分子设计的启发，其中扩展的π共轭体系不仅可以稳定+1或-1荷电状态，还可以促进电荷传输，（31）我们在此着重介绍分子设计，即利用扩展π共轭系统的优势来改善电池性能并解决当前快速充电和放电的挑战。 π共轭体系的扩展是可预测的，这有利于快速电荷的传输和收集，并改善了在快速充放电过程中对Na离子的快速插入/抽取的耐受性。同时，扩展π共轭体系也有助于增强分子间的相互作用（例如π–π或C–H··π相互作用），这可能导致逐层的分子排列。这种逐层的分子排列有望为两层之间的离子扩散形成一条快速途径。为了验证我们的假设，选择了第一个被广泛报道的有机钠电池小分子（29），即苯二羧酸钠（SBDC，图1a），（17-19）作为起始分子。为了扩展其π共轭体系，可以使用三个可能的键，包括碳-碳单键，双键和三键，形成扩展的π共轭分子，从而得到分子1，SSDC（4,4'-二苯乙烯钠-二羧酸盐）和2（图1a）。文献表明，由于相邻芳环之间的空间位阻，CC单键将导致非平面结构（16，31-33）无疑会损害π共轭的扩展，从而损害电荷传输。 （34-36）同样，由于C itsC键连接材料的电子云形状和可能的旋转（也导致非平面结构），其π共轭比C thanC键基材料低。 （31，36，37）因此，在这里，选择碳-碳双键作为扩展SBDCπ共轭体系的键。考虑到分子量的进一步增加将降低比容量，包含两个苯环且理论比容量为172 mAh g–1的SSDC被设计为模型，用于研究扩展π共轭体系对碳纳米管的影响。快速充电和放电的钠电池。

The present report shows that the reasonable molecular design indeed efficiently increases the π-conjugation of the material. This leads to an improved reversible capacity of 220 mAh g–1 under the current density of 50 mA g–1, although the nearly doubled molecular weight should largely decrease its theoretical specific capacity. Remarkably, the reasonable extension of the π-conjugation delivered much better high rate performance than the starting molecule and can be fully recovered even after cycled at rate as high as 10 A g–1. This performance is among the highest performances for organic SIBs.

### Results and Discussion
The synthesis and the corresponding redox reaction of SSDC are presented in Figure 1b. SSDC was synthesized for the first time through an environmentally friendly one-pot reaction of 4,4-stilbenedicarboxylic acid (HSDC) with sodium hydroxide in ethanol according to a literature procedure(29) (for details see Experimental section). From the FT-IR spectra (Figure 2a), it is clear that the broad peak in the range from 3000 to 2500 cm–1 which belongs to the stretching vibration of O–H bond disappeared in the spectrum of the product SSDC. On the other hand, the fingerprint peaks of carboxylic acid around 1680 cm–1 which is identified to the stretching vibration of C═O bond and around 1320 and 1290 cm–1 which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of C–O bond also disappeared. These results indicate the pure formation of SSDC. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR (300 MHz, D2O) further confirmed the formation and purity of the sodium carboxylates (see Figures S1 and S2).The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (Figure 2b) showed the existence of sodium, with an atom ratio of oxygen and sodium (2.07:1) equal to the theoretical ratio (2:1). All of these confirmed the formation and purity of our model molecule. Figure 2c shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of SSDC and SBDC in water solution at the concentration of 10–5 M. Clearly, the maximum absorption of SSDC was red shifted by more than 50 nm compared with SBDC, indicating a much smaller HOMO–LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbit and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit) energy gap of SSDC (3.49 and 4.18 eV for SSDC and SBDC, respectively). The smaller energy gap of SSDC implies a much larger π-conjugated system through our efficient molecular design and thereby a higher electric stability and conductivity.(27, 37)
