## Abstract
Organic sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential alternatives of current commercial inorganic lithium-ion batteries for portable electronics (especially wearable electronics) because of their low cost and flexibility, making them possible to meet the future flexible and large-scale requirements. However, only a few organic SIBs have been reported so far, and most of them either were tested in a very slow rate or suffered significant performance degradation when cycled under high rate. Here, we are focusing on the molecular design for improving the battery performance and addressing the current challenge of fast-charge and -discharge. Through reasonable molecular design strategy, we demonstrate that the extension of the π-conjugated system is an efficient way to improve the high rate performance, leading to much enhanced capacity and cyclability with full recovery even after cycled under current density as high as 10 A g–1.  
有机钠离子电池（SIB）由于其低成本和高灵活性而成为当前用于便携式电子产品（尤其是可穿戴电子产品）的商用无机锂离子电池的潜在替代品，从而使其有可能满足未来的柔性和大规模需求。但是，到目前为止，仅报道了少数几种有机SIB，其中大多数要么以很慢的速率进行测试，要么以高速率循环时性能显着下降。在这里，我们专注于分子设计，以改善电池性能并解决当前快速充电和放电的挑战。通过合理的分子设计策略，我们证明了π共轭体系的扩展是一种提高高倍率性能的有效方法，即使在电流密度高达10 A g –1的条件下循环后，也可以大大提高容量和循环能力，并具有完全恢复的能力。

## Introduciton
Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have played an important role in power supply for portable electronic devices in the past two decades.(1-7) However, it meets a fatal challenge that the resources of lithium will run out in a few years. Researchers have found that rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising alternative candidates for the next-generation battery systems, based on much cheaper, nontoxic, and more abundant sodium-based materials. The reason is that sodium-based materials have similar electrochemical process with lithium-based materials and the electrochemical potential of sodium is similar to that of lithium (only 0.3 V more positive).(7-21) However, one challenge that the widely studied inorganic SIBs encounter is that the Na-ion is larger than Li-ion (diameter: 2.32 vs 1.80 Å), which may increase the difficulty of insertion/extraction of the Na-ions and even destroy the rigid structure of the materials. Besides, inorganic materials are limited resources and are always nondegradable. They usually need tedious synthesis and purification. Therefore, from a practical point of view, organic materials are more attractive alternatives for power supply especially in the future flexible and large-scale applications. This is due to the various advantages of organic materials: lightweight, flexibility, vast resources, solution processability, recyclability, and easily functionalized for improving the electrochemical performance.(1-4, 12-31) However, until now, only a few organic materials have been applied in SIBs.(12-21) Even worse, most of the previously reported organic SIBs were tested in a very slow charge/discharge process (e.g., 10 mA g–1, which takes a very long time for a charge/discharge cycle),(13-18) and those tested under fast charge/discharge process often led to significant performance degradation.(19-21) These naturally limit their potential applications.  
在过去的二十年中，可充电锂离子电池在便携式电子设备的电源供应中发挥了重要作用。（1-7）然而，锂的资源将在几年后耗尽，这是一个致命的挑战。研究人员发现，基于便宜得多，无毒且更丰富的钠基材料，可充电钠离子电池（SIB）是下一代电池系统最有希望的替代品之一。原因是钠基材料的电化学过程与锂基材料相似，并且钠的电化学势与锂相似（正电压仅高0.3 V）。（7-21）**然而，这是一项被广泛研究的挑战无机SIB遇到的问题是Na离子比Li离子大（直径：2.32 vs 1.80Å），这可能会增加Na离子的插入/提取难度，甚至破坏材料的刚性结构。** 此外，无机材料是有限的资源，并且总是不可降解的。他们通常需要乏味的合成和纯化。因此，从实际的角度来看，有机材料是电源的更有吸引力的替代品，尤其是在未来的柔性和大规模应用中。这归因于有机材料的各种优势：轻巧，柔软，资源丰富，溶液可加工性，可回收性以及易于功能化以提高电化学性能。（1-4，12-31）然而，到目前为止，只有少数几种有机材料（12-21）更糟糕的是，大多数先前报道的有机SIB都是在非常慢的充电/放电过程中进行测试的（例如10 mA g–1，这需要很长时间才能充电） /放电周期），（13-18）和在快速充电/放电过程中测试的结果通常会导致性能显着下降。（19-21）这些自然限制了它们的潜在应用。

In order to achieve high rate performance, there is no doubt that three aspects are very critical, including the charge transport and collection, the stability of the charged and discharged states, and the ion diffusion. Inspired from the molecular design of organic semiconductors in organic electronics where the extended π-conjugated system can not only stabilize the +1 or −1 charged states but also facilitate the charge transport,(31) we herein focus on the molecular design, i.e., using the advantages of extended π-conjugated system for improving the battery performance and addressing the current challenge of fast-charge and -discharge. The extension of the π-conjugated system is predictable to be conducive to fast charge transport and collection and to improve the toleration to the fast insertion/extraction of Na-ions during the fast-charge and -discharge process. Simultaneously, extending the π-conjugated system is also helpful to strengthen the intermolecular interactions (e.g., π–π or C–H···π interactions) which might lead to a layer-by-layer molecular arrangement. This layer-by-layer molecular arrangement is expected to form a fast route for ion diffusion between two layers. In order to verify our assumption, the first and widely reported small molecule(29) for organic sodium batteries, sodium benzene-dicarboxylate (SBDC, Figure 1a),(17-19) is selected as starting molecule. In order to extend its π-conjugated system, three possible linkages, including carbon–carbon single, double, and triple bond, can be used to form extended π-conjugated molecules, giving molecule 1, SSDC (sodium 4,4′-stilbene-dicarboxylate), and 2 respectively (Figure 1a). The literatures have shown that the C–C single bond would lead to a nonplanar structure because of the steric hindrance between the adjacent aromatic rings,(16, 31-33) which unambiguously harms the extension of π-conjugation and thus impairs the charge transport and electric stability.(34-36) Similarly, due to its electron cloud shape and the possible rotation (also leading to nonplanar structure), the C≡C bond linked material possesses a lower π-conjugation than that of C═C bond based material as well.(31, 36, 37) Therefore, here, the carbon–carbon double bond is selected as the linkage to extend the π-conjugated system of SBDC. Considering the further increase in the molecular weight will decrease the specific capacity, SSDC, containing two benzene rings and offering a theoretical specific capacity of 172 mAh g–1, is designed as a model to investigate the influence of extended π-conjugated system on the fast-charge and -discharge sodium batteries.  
**为了获得高速率性能，毫无疑问，三个方面非常关键，包括电荷传输和收集，充电和放电状态的稳定性以及离子扩散。** 受到有机电子学中有机半导体分子设计的启发，其中扩展的π共轭体系不仅可以稳定+1或-1荷电状态，还可以促进电荷传输，（31）我们在此着重介绍分子设计，即利用扩展π共轭系统的优势来改善电池性能并解决当前快速充电和放电的挑战。 **π共轭体系的扩展是可预测的，这有利于快速电荷的传输和收集，并改善了在快速充放电过程中对Na离子的快速插入/抽取的耐受性。同时，扩展π共轭体系也有助于增强分子间的相互作用（例如π–π或C–H··π相互作用），这可能导致逐层的分子排列。这种逐层的分子排列有望为两层之间的离子扩散形成一条快速途径。** 为了验证我们的假设，选择了第一个被广泛报道的有机钠电池小分子（29），即苯二羧酸钠（SBDC，图1a），（17-19）作为起始分子。为了扩展其π共轭体系，可以使用三个可能的键，包括碳-碳单键，双键和三键，形成扩展的π共轭分子，从而得到分子1，SSDC（4,4'-二苯乙烯钠-二羧酸盐）和2（图1a）。文献表明，由于相邻芳环之间的空间位阻，CC单键将导致非平面结构（16，31-33）无疑会损害π共轭的扩展，从而损害电荷传输。 （34-36）同样，由于C itsC键连接材料的电子云形状和可能的旋转（也导致非平面结构），其π共轭比C thanC键基材料低。 （31，36，37）因此，在这里，选择碳-碳双键作为扩展SBDCπ共轭体系的键。考虑到分子量的进一步增加将降低比容量，包含两个苯环且理论比容量为172 mAh g–1的SSDC被设计为研究扩展π共轭体系对快充和放电钠电池的影响的模型。

The present report shows that the reasonable molecular design indeed efficiently increases the π-conjugation of the material. This leads to an improved reversible capacity of 220 mAh g–1 under the current density of 50 mA g–1, although the nearly doubled molecular weight should largely decrease its theoretical specific capacity. Remarkably, the reasonable extension of the π-conjugation delivered much better high rate performance than the starting molecule and can be fully recovered even after cycled at rate as high as 10 A g–1. This performance is among the highest performances for organic SIBs.  
本报告表明合理的分子设计确实有效地增加了材料的π共轭。这导致在50 mA g–1的电流密度下220 mAh g–1的可逆容量有所提高，尽管近乎两倍的分子量会大大降低其理论比容量。值得注意的是，π共轭的合理延伸比起始分子具有更高的高倍率性能，即使以高达10 A g-1的速率循环后也可以完全恢复。该性能是有机SIB的最高性能之一。

## Results and Discussion
The synthesis and the corresponding redox reaction of SSDC are presented in Figure 1b. SSDC was synthesized for the first time through an environmentally friendly one-pot reaction of 4,4-stilbenedicarboxylic acid (HSDC) with sodium hydroxide in ethanol according to a literature procedure(29) (for details see Experimental section). From the FT-IR spectra (Figure 2a), it is clear that the broad peak in the range from 3000 to 2500 cm–1 which belongs to the stretching vibration of O–H bond disappeared in the spectrum of the product SSDC. On the other hand, the fingerprint peaks of carboxylic acid around 1680 cm–1 which is identified to the stretching vibration of C═O bond and around 1320 and 1290 cm–1 which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of C–O bond also disappeared. These results indicate the pure formation of SSDC. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR (300 MHz, D2O) further confirmed the formation and purity of the sodium carboxylates (see Figures S1 and S2).The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (Figure 2b) showed the existence of sodium, with an atom ratio of oxygen and sodium (2.07:1) equal to the theoretical ratio (2:1). All of these confirmed the formation and purity of our model molecule. Figure 2c shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of SSDC and SBDC in water solution at the concentration of 10–5 M. Clearly, the maximum absorption of SSDC was red shifted by more than 50 nm compared with SBDC, indicating a much smaller HOMO–LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbit and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit) energy gap of SSDC (3.49 and 4.18 eV for SSDC and SBDC, respectively). The smaller energy gap of SSDC implies a much larger π-conjugated system through our efficient molecular design and thereby a higher electric stability and conductivity.(27, 37)  
SSDC的合成及其相应的氧化还原反应如图1b所示。SSDC是通过4,4-苯乙烯基二羧酸（HSDC）与氢氧化钠在乙醇中的环保单锅反应根据文献程序（29）首次合成的（详细信息请参见实验部分）。从FT-IR光谱（图2a）中可以明显看出，属于O-H键拉伸振动的3000至2500 cm-1范围内的宽峰在产物SSDC的光谱中消失了。另一方面，羧酸的指纹峰在1680 cm-1附近被确认为C═O键的拉伸振动，而在1320和1290 cm-1附近则被归为C-O键的拉伸振动也消失了。1H NMR和13C NMR（300 MHz，D2O）进一步证实了羧酸钠的形成和纯度（见图S1和S2）。能量色散光谱（EDS）光谱（图2b）显示了钠的存在，并且氧与钠的原子比（2.07：1）等于理论比（2：1）。所有这些都证实了我们模型分子的形成和纯度。图2c显示了在浓度为10-5 M时，水溶液中SSDC和SBDC的紫外可见吸收光谱。很明显，**与SBDC相比，SSDC的最大吸收红移了50 nm以上，表明SSDC的HOMO-LUMO更小**，（SSDC和SBDC分别为3.49和4.18 eV）。通过我们有效的分子设计，SSDC的较小的能隙意味着更大的π共轭体系，从而具有更高的电稳定性和电导率。（27，37）

The self-assembly characteristics of SSDC is conducted by using drop-casting of SSDC solution in water onto silicon substrates, which resulted in two-dimensional (2D) micrometer sized plates with mica-like terrace surface, as shown Figure 3a. This mica-like terrace edges can also be observed in the as-prepared submicrometer-sized product of SSDC from the one-pot reaction (see scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figures S3 and S4). On the other hand, the self-assembly of SBDC showed microrod morphologies (Figure 3b). According to the Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker (BFDH) rules,(31, 35, 38, 39) the crystals are preferable to grow along the direction with strong intermolecular interactions. Therefore, this terrace morphology suggests that the intermolecular interactions of SSDC along the short axis (π–π or C–H···π interactions) are much stronger than that of the long axis direction where only weak van der Waals’ force exists. This implies that the extension of the π-conjugated system enhanced the intermolecular interactions of SSDC, and the SSDC molecules are packing as layer-by-layer mode (Figure 3c). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern further proves this assumption (Figure 2d). From the XRD pattern, the product exhibited strong (00l) peaks. The d-spacing of (00l) is around 15.6 Å, which is close to the calculated molecular length (14–15 Å, by roughly using the carbon–carbon bond length of 1.4 Å, the length of C═O bond of 1.2 Å and the diameter of Na-ion of 2.32 Å). According to the Crystallography Open Database (COD number: 7105617), the molecular length of the carboxylate anion (SDC2–) is also around 14 Å, giving a total molecular length of about 14.5 Å. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the crystal surface shows that the typical step height of the terrace layers was about 3.2 nm, almost equal to two times of the molecular length (Figure S5). The agreement between the experimental length and the theoretical value suggests that the molecules adopt a lamellar packing motif with the carboxylate groups situated on the two surfaces of each layer in the solid states (Figure 3c). Such kind of packing and the larger d-spacing distance than the length of molecules make it possible to form a fast diffusion channel for insertion/extraction of Na-ions into/from the interspace between the layers, where the electrochemical reaction happens.  
SSDC的自组装特性是通过将SSDC水溶液在水中滴铸到硅基板上来进行的，这导致了具有云母状平台表面的二维（2D）微米级板，如图3a所示。从一锅法反应中，也可以在准备好的亚微米尺寸的SSDC产品中观察到这种云母状的台面边缘（请参见图S3和S4中的扫描电子显微镜（SEM）图像）。另一方面，SBDC的自组装显示出微棒形态（图3b）。根据**Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker（BFDH）规则（31，35，38，39），晶体最好沿具有强烈分子间相互作用的方向生长**。因此，这种阶地形态表明，SSDC沿短轴的分子间相互作用（π–π或C–H···π相互作用）比仅存在弱范德华力的长轴方向的分子间相互作用强得多。这意味着π共轭体系的扩展增强了SSDC的分子间相互作用，并且SSDC分子以逐层模式堆积（图3c）。 X射线衍射（XRD）模式进一步证明了这一假设（图2d）。根据XRD图谱，产物显示出强的（00l）峰。 （00l）的d间距大约为15.6Å，接近于计算出的分子长度（14-15Å，通过大致使用1.4Å的碳-碳键长度，1.2Å的C═O键长度） Na离子的直径为2.32Å）。根据晶体学开放数据库（COD编号：7105617），羧酸根阴离子（SDC2-）的分子长度也约为14Å，总分子长度约为14.5Å。晶体表面的原子力显微镜（AFM）图像显示，平台层的典型台阶高度约为3.2 nm，几乎等于分子长度的两倍（图S5）。实验长度与理论值之间的一致性表明，分子采用层状堆积基序，其中羧酸盐基团位于固态的每一层的两个表面上（图3c）。这种堆积和比分子长度更大的d-间隔距离使得可以形成快速扩散通道，用于将Na离子插入/从发生电化学反应的层之间的间隙中插入/抽出。

To verify our assumption that the extended π-conjugation is really beneficial to the battery performance, the electrochemical performance of SSDC electrode was investigated by using a half cell with a sodium metal as the counter electrode. The SSDC electrodes were obtained by mixing the products with carbon black (Super-P) as conductive additive and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as binder in water. Figure 4a shows typical cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the half-cell. From the CV curves, SSDC showed one reduction peak around 0.39 V (vs Na/Na+) during the cathodic scan, corresponding to the insertion of two Na-ions. This potential is higher than that of SBDC (0.18 V, Figure S6), indicating that the extended π-conjugated system can significantly increase the redox potential. The anodic scan gives an oxidization peak around 0.66 V (vs. Na/Na+), which suggests the extraction of Na-ions. The currents of the reduction peaks decrease gradually in the first seven cycles and become steady afterward. On the other hand, the curves of the anodic scan do not change obviously after the second cycle. Moreover, the intensity of the reduction peaks becomes similar to that of the oxidization peaks after seven cycles. These suggest an irreversible reduction of the electrolyte in the first seven cycles, which probably can be ascribed to the irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The currents of the reduction and oxidization become matched with each other after seven cycles, indicating that the redox reaction is reversible. The stability of the current after seven cycles also suggests that the former irreversible reduction should be due to the SEI phenomenon and the reversible electrochemical reaction is originated from the active material SSDC. Because the oxidization peak of monosodium product should be at a lower electric potential,(16) the peaks around 0.78 and 1.0 V which disappear in the subsequent cycles are probably originated from the additive, trace amorphous SSDC or ion adsorption (also see below).  
为了验证我们的假设，即扩展的π共轭对电池性能确实有好处，我们使用钠金属半电池作为对电极研究了SSDC电极的电化学性能。通过将产品与炭黑（Super-P）作为导电添加剂和羧甲基纤维素钠（CMC）作为粘合剂在水中混合，获得SSDC电极。图4a显示了半电池的典型循环伏安图（CV）。从CV曲线来看，SSDC在阴极扫描期间显示出一个约0.39 V（vs Na /Na +）的还原峰，对应于两个Na离子的插入。该电势高于SBDC的电势（0.18 V，图S6），表明扩展的π共轭体系可以显着提高氧化还原电势。阳极扫描给出约0.66 V（vs。Na /Na +）的氧化峰，这表明提取了Na离子。还原峰的电流在前七个循环中逐渐减小，然后稳定。另一方面，在第二周期之后，阳极扫描的曲线没有明显改变。此外，在七个循环之后，还原峰的强度变得类似于氧化峰的强度。这些表明在最初的七个循环中电解质的不可逆减少，这可能归因于固体电解质中间相（SEI）的不可逆形成。还原和氧化的电流在七个循环后变得彼此匹配，表明氧化还原反应是可逆的。七个循环后电流的稳定性还表明，前者不可逆的减少应归因于SEI现象，而可逆的电化学反应则源自活性物质SSDC。由于一钠产品的氧化峰应处于较低电位，（16）在随后循环中消失的0.78和1.0 V附近的峰可能源自添加剂，痕量无定形SSDC或离子吸附（另见下文）。

Figure 4b shows the charge–discharge profiles of the SSDC electrodes between 2.5 and 0.1 V at a rate of 50 mA g–1. The first discharge delivers a capacity of about 375 mAh g–1. However, upon the recharge, a capacity of about 260 mAh g–1 was observed, giving a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the first cycle (ca. 69%). This probably could be ascribed to the irreversible SEI phenomenon, trace amorphous SSDC or ion adsorption, which can be inferred from the difference of discharge profiles between first and subsequent cycles within the voltage range from 0.7 to 0.4 V. From the 10th cycle, the Coulombic efficiency becomes higher than 98% (Figure 4c). There are three clear plateaus located at ca. 0.95, 0.75, and 0.61 V in the first recharge profile. The plateau at ca. 0.95 V, which also can be observed in the CV curve (∼1.0 V in Figure 4a), could be attributed to the ion adsorption rather than resistance interface, which will disappear in the subsequent cycles (see Figure S7).(40) The plateau at 0.75 V (∼0.78 V in Figure 4a) can be assigned to the contribution of Super-P (Figure S8), which is much smaller than SSDC and thereby is covered by the plateau of SSDC during cycling (Figure 4a,b). The plateau at 0.61 V (∼0.66 V in Figure 4a), corresponding to the plateau at 0.45 V in the discharge profile, can be ascribed to the reversible oxidization/reduction of the two carbonyl groups with extraction/insertion of two Na cations. Because of the safety problem(17, 41) from the formation of the Na metal dendrite arisen around 0 V and the potential irreversible reaction of the mixed carbon materials and electrolyte (Figure S8), the redox potential of SSDC is ideal as anode material for SIBs. As a control experiment, this plateau is about 0.2 V higher than that of the SBDC electrodes (see Figure S6). In addition, the capacity becomes stable after the 10th cycle, giving a capacity as high as 222 mAh g–1 and keeping 204 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles with a capacity retention higher than 90% (Figure 4c), suggesting its excellent cyclability. Considering the weight ratio of the active material and carbon black, the total theoretical capacity should be the sum capacity of the active material and the carbon black, which equals to 252 mAh g–1 (=172 + 100 mAh g–1 × 40 wt % Super P/50 wt % SSDC) with at most 80 mAh g–1 contributed from carbon black. Therefore, the obtained value is almost close to the theoretical capacity. This capacity is among the highest values for both organic lithium and sodium batteries. On the other hand, under the same condition, the SBDC (which has a much smaller π-conjugated system) electrodes only deliver a capacity of 192 mAh g–1 for the second cycle and decrease to 162 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles (Figure S6), although the molecular weight of SSDC is nearly doubled of SBDC (total theoretical capacity of SBDC electrodes: 335 mAh g–1 (=255 + 100 mAh g–1 × 40 wt % Super P/50 wt % SBDC) leading to a much smaller theoretical specific capacity. These results prove that the appropriate extension of the π-conjugated system can increase the capacity and improve the cyclability.  
图4b显示了2.5到0.1 V之间的SSDC电极在50 mA g-1的速率下的充放电曲线。第一次放电的容量约为375 mAh g-1。然而，充电后，观察到约260 mAh g–1的容量，第一循环的库仑效率（CE）低（约69％）。这可能归因于不可逆的SEI现象，痕量无定形SSDC或离子吸附，这可以从电压范围为0.7至0.4 V的第一个循环和后续循环之间的放电曲线差异来推断。从第十个循环开始，库仑效率高于98％（图4c）。在第一个充电曲线中，有三个清晰的高原分别位于0.95、0.75和0.61V。在CV曲线中也可以观察到0.95 V处的平稳期（在图4a中约为1.0 V），**这可以归因于离子吸附而不是电阻界面，该离子吸附将在随后的循环中消失（见图S7）。**（40）**可以将0.75 V（图4a中的〜0.78 V）的平稳段分配给Super-P（图S8）**，这比SSDC小得多，因此在循环期间被SSDC的平稳段覆盖（图4a，b） 。在0.61 V时的平稳段（图4a中约为0.66 V），对应于放电曲线中在0.45 V时的平稳段，可以归因于两个羰基的萃取/插入两个Na阳离子的可逆氧化/还原。由于安全问题（17，41）是由于在**0 V附近出现Na金属枝晶的形成以及混合碳材料和电解质的潜在不可逆反应**（图S8），SSDC的氧化还原电势是理想的阳极材料SIB。作为对照实验，该平台电压比SBDC电极的平台电压高约0.2 V（见图S6）。此外，在第10次循环后，容量变得稳定，提供高达222 mAh g–1的容量，并在50次循环后保持204 mAh g–1的容量，保持率高于90％（图4c），表明其出色的循环能力。**考虑到活性材料和炭黑的重量比，总理论容量应为活性材料和炭黑的总容量，等于252 mAh g–1（=172 + 100 mAh g–1 × 40 wt % Super P/50 wt % SSDC），碳黑最多可产生80 mAh g–1的电量**。因此，获得的值几乎接近理论容量。该容量是有机锂电池和钠电池的最高容量之一。另一方面，在相同条件下，SBDC（具有较小的π共轭体系）电极在第二个循环中仅提供192 mAh g-1的容量，在50个循环后减小至162 mAh g-1（图S6），尽管SSDC的分子量几乎是SBDC的两倍（SBDC电极的总理论容量：335 mAh g–1（=255 + 100 mAh g–1 × 40 wt % Super P/50 wt % SBDC）这些结果证明，π共轭体系的适当扩展可以增加容量并改善可循环性。

In order to investigate the influence of extended π-conjugated system on fast-charge and -discharge processes, the SSDC and SBDC electrodes are tested under different high rates. The high rate performance are important properties for the practical application. Remarkably, the SSDC electrodes exhibited much better rate performance than SBDC (Figure 5a). It delivers a capacity higher than 100 mAh g–1 even at a 2 A g–1 rate. The capacities at 5 A g–1 and 10 A g–1 are still as high as 90 and 72 mAh g–1, respectively. In this case, only several minutes or even tens of seconds are required for a full charge. The capacity also can be fully recovered after cycled at rate as high as 10 A g–1 (Figure 5a). From Figure 5b, it is clear that the plateau for reduction/oxidization of SSDC in the discharge/charge profiles only change slightly (∼0.1 V) at 5 A g–1. The plateau of SSDC still exists at 10 A g–1 with reduction potential around 0.25 V (a 0.2 V shift). This is meaningful, because as mentioned above a suitable redox potential is very important to prevent the possible formation of Na metal dendrite and other degradation around 0 V. However, as a control experiment, the discharge profile of SBDC becomes sloping when the current density increases to 1 A g–1 and all the capacity of SBDC is distributed to potential lower than 0.2 V at 5 A g–1 (Figure S6, also see literature).(17) Similarly, all the capacity of Super-P is distributed to potential lower than 0.1 V at 10 A g–1 (Figure S8). From Figure 5a, it is clear that in our condition, the SSDC electrodes deliver a capacity a little higher than that of SBDC when charged/discharged slowly, although its theoretical capacity is lower (also see Figure 4b-c and S6). However, under fast-charge and −discharge rate, SSDC showed a much better rate performance than that of SBDC. The capacity of SBDC degraded to 32 and 22 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1 and 10 A g–1, respectively. These values are even lower than those of Super-P (54 and 40 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1 and 10 A g–1, respectively), which may be due to an increasing resistance interface of SBDC during cycling (see following).  
为了研究扩展的π共轭体系对快速充电和放电过程的影响，在不同的高倍率下测试了SSDC和SBDC电极。高速率性能是实际应用的重要属性。值得注意的是，SSDC电极显示出比SBDC更好的倍率性能（图5a）。即使以2 A g–1的速率提供，其容量也高于100 mAh g–1。 5 A g–1和10 A g–1的容量仍分别高达90和72 mAh g–1。在这种情况下，充满电只需要几分钟甚至几十秒。以高达10 A g-1的速率循环后，容量也可以完全恢复（图5a）。**从图5b可以明显看出，在5 A g-1时，放电/充电曲线中SSDC的还原/氧化平稳期仅略有变化（〜0.1 V）。 SSDC的平稳状态仍然存在于10 A g–1处，其还原电位约为0.25 V（偏移0.2 V）**。这是有意义的，因为如上所述，合适的氧化还原电势对于防止可能形成Na金属枝晶和其他在0 V附近的降解非常重要。但是，作为对照实验，当电流密度增加时，SBDC的放电曲线变得倾斜至1 A g–1，并且SBDC的所有容量均在5 A g–1时分配至低于0.2 V的电势（图S6，另请参见文献）。（17）类似地，Super-P的所有容量均分配至10 A g–1时电势低于0.1 V（图S8）。从图5a可以明显看出，在我们的条件下，SSC电极在缓慢充电/放电时的容量略高于SBDC，尽管其理论容量较低（另请参见图4b-c和S6）。但是，在快速充电和-放电速率下，SSDC显示出比SBDC更好的速率性能。在5 A g-1和10 A g-1时，SBDC的容量分别降至32和22 mAh g-1。这些值甚至低于Super-P的值（分别在5 A g-1和10 A g-1时分别为54和40 mAh g-1），这可能是由于SBDC在循环过程中电阻界面的增加（请参见以下）。

Figure 5c shows the cyclability of the SSDC electrodes at a 1 A g–1 rate, delivering a capacity of 247 mAh g–1 for the first cycle with Coulombic efficiency as high as 80%. Incredibly, the Coulombic efficiency increases to 98% after 5 cycles, giving a capacity up to 160 mAh g–1. After 400 cycles, the capacity is still as high as 112 mAh g–1 with retention higher than 70%. Figure 5c shows a visible comparison of SSDC and SBDC electrodes measured under current density of 1 A g–1, in which SBDC also provides a comparable capacity of 225 mAh g–1 for the first cycle but with Coulombic efficiency as low as 49%. The capacity kept on decreasing to 95 mAh g–1 in the first 20 cycles with Coulombic efficiency lower than 98%. After 150 cycles, its capacity deceases dramatically leading to a capacity even lower than individual Super-P. Its capacity degraded to 62 mAh g–1 after 400 cycles. These results show that the extension of π-conjugated system is also capable to improve the capacity and cyclability under fast-charge and -discharge rates.  
图5c显示了SSDC电极在1 A g-1速率下的可循环性，第一个循环的容量为247 mAh g-1，库仑效率高达80％。令人难以置信的是，经过5个循环后，库仑效率提高到98％，容量达到160 mAh g–1。在400次循环之后，容量仍高达112 mAh g–1，保留率高于70％。图5c显示了在1 A g–1的电流密度下测得的SSDC和SBDC电极的可见比较，其中SBDC在第一个循环中也可提供225 mAh g–1的可比容量，但库仑效率低至49％。在前20个循环中，容量继续降低至95 mAh g-1，库仑效率低于98％。经过150次循环后，其容量急剧下降，导致容量甚至低于单个Super-P。 400次循环后，其容量下降至62 mAh g-1。这些结果表明，π共轭体系的扩展还能够改善快速充电和放电速率下的容量和循环性。

In order to get a further insight of the SSDC electrodes during the cycling, the ex situ measurement of its SEM images, EDS spectra, XRD patterns, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are studied. From the SEM images of the SSDC electrodes (Figure S3), it is clear that even after 50 cycles of discharge and charge cycles, the morphology change is negligible. All of them exhibit terrace morphology. The diffraction peak of the films (Figure 4d) after first discharge shows a slight shift from 15.8 to16.1 Å. The [001] d-spacing of the thin films (15.8 Å) is a little larger than that of the powders (15.6 Å, Figure 2d), which is probably due to the different solvents (ethanol for the powders and water for the thin films). On the other hand, this [001] d-spacing exhibited a slight increase after discharge (from 15.8 to16.1 Å), which is understandable because both of the insertion of the Na-ions and the decreased unsaturation bonds in the discharged state will elongate the molecule. This is also the reason that only variation of the [001] d-spacing is presented here because the strongest diffraction and the largest variation exist in the c axis. However, the volume change even along this axis is negligible (from 15.8 to16.1 Å, < 2%), which can be ascribed to the softness of the organic materials and the weaker intermolecular interactions between two layers (this also confirmed the assumption that the strong π–π intermolecular interaction facilitates a lamellar stacking). The d-spacing can be recovered after recharge and did not show any obvious change even after charge and discharge 50 cycles. The absence of a phase transformation,(42) the slight variation of d-spacing after discharge, the recovery of the d-spacing after charge, and the terrace structure suggest there is a preferential route between two layers for diffusion of Na-ions (Figure 3c), which probably is one reason that the electrodes can give high performance even charged/discharged under high current densities. EDS spectra are used for analyzing the change of the elemental components in the electrodes during cycling. Because CMC also contains oxygen, poly(vinylidenedifluoride) (PVDF) instead of CMC was utilized as the binder in these electrode films. On the other hand, CMC is chosen as the binder in the battery test because of it’s higher conductivity, environmentally friendly (the solvent is water), and low cost.(17, 40) Furthermore, the active material is soluble in water but insoluble in NMP (the solvent for PVDF), which results in a better mixing than that of PVDF. This will improve the charge transport and the diffusion of the electrolyte. The EDS spectra of the films show a clear variation of oxygen and Na-atom ratio from 2.07, 1.08 to 1.70, which agrees well with the theoretical ratio from 2, 1 to 2 (Figure S9 and Table S1). This result reconfirmed the mechanism that the insertion and extraction of the Na-ions are through the reduction and the subsequent oxidization of the C═O bonds, and there are no other side-reactions or additional mechanisms to contribute the total electrochemical performance.(17-19, 28, 29) The ratio after recharge is a little lower than the theoretical ratio, which can be ascribed to the lower stability (Figures S4 and S10) and worse compatibility of PVDF binder (PVDF is a lyophobic material, which is not good for the diffusion of electrolyte). The EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 5 mHz for investigating the Na-ions diffusion in the electrolyte and migration through the SEI and the charge transfer through the SEI and diffusion in the electrodes. Figure 5d shows the Nyquist plots of SSDC electrodes after discharging to 0.1 V during cycling. Interestingly, the impedance shows insignificant change even after 30 charge/discharge cycles with resistance around 108 Ω, suggesting the stability of the electrodes during cycling. On the other hand, the impedance especially the semicircle in the middle-frequency region increases dramatically during the cycling in the Nyquist plots of the SBDC electrodes, indicating that the interface resistance increases during cycling, which may be a reason that the SBDC electrode showed much worse performance (Figure S11). This increase of the interface resistance might be ascribed to the short π-conjugated system of SBDC, which leads to lower charge transport and stability. From these analyses, we believed that the high capacities with high cyclability of SSDC electrodes are probably due to the extended π-conjugated system because it can: (1) improve the charge transport and stabilize the charged and discharged states and (2) enhance the intermolecular interactions and the resulted terrace packing structure facilitates the insertion/extraction of the Na-ions. It should be noted that SSDC also showed a much better high rate performance than that of the material(16) with carbon–carbon single bond linkage, which again proved the efficiency of extending π-conjugated system on high rate performance.  
为了进一步了解SSDC电极在循环过程中的特性，研究了其SEM图像，EDS光谱，XRD图和电化学阻抗谱（EIS）的异位测量。从SSDC电极的SEM图像（图S3）可以清楚地看到，即使经过50次放电和充电循环，其形态变化也可以忽略不计。它们都表现出梯田形态。首次放电后，薄膜的衍射峰（图4d）显示出从15.8到16.1Å的轻微偏移。薄膜的[001] d间距（15.8Å）略大于粉末的[001] d间距（15.6Å，图2d），这可能是由于溶剂不同（粉末的乙醇和薄的水）电影）。另一方面，该[001] d-间距在放电后表现出轻微的增加（从15.8到16.1Å），这是可以理解的，因为在放电状态下Na离子的插入和减少的不饱和键都会降低。延长分子。这也是因为在c轴上存在最强的衍射和最大的变化，所以这里仅显示[001] d间距的变化的原因。但是，即使沿该轴的体积变化也可以忽略不计（从15.8到16.1Å，<2％），这可以归因于有机材料的柔软性和两层之间较弱的分子间相互作用（这也证实了以下假设：强大的π-π分子间相互作用促进了层状堆积）。 d间隔可在充电后恢复，并且即使在充电和放电50个循环后也没有显示任何明显的变化。没有相变，（42）放电后d间距略有变化，充电后d间距恢复，平台结构表明，在两层之间存在一条优先的途径来扩散Na离子（图3c），这可能是电极即使在高电流密度下充电/放电也能提供高性能的原因之一。 EDS光谱用于分析循环过程中电极中元素的变化。由于CMC也包含氧，因此在这些电极膜中使用聚偏二氟乙烯（PVDF）代替CMC作为粘合剂。**另一方面，由于CMC具有较高的导电性，环境友好性（溶剂为水）和低成本，因此被选作电池测试的粘合剂。**（17，40）此外，活性物质可溶于水但不溶于水在NMP（PVDF的溶剂）中混合，比PVDF的混合效果更好。这将改善电荷传输和电解质的扩散。薄膜的EDS光谱显示，氧和钠原子的比率从2.07、1.08到1.70有明显变化，这与理论比率从2、1到2非常吻合（图S9和表S1）。**该结果再次证实了Na离子的插入和提取是通过C═O键的还原和随后的氧化来完成的，并且没有其他副反应或其他机制来贡献总的电化学性能。**（17 -19、28、29）充电后的比率略低于理论比率，这可以归因于较低的稳定性（图S4和S10）和PVDF粘合剂的相容性较差（PVDF是疏液材料，不是有利于电解质的扩散）。 EIS测量在1 MHz至5 mHz的频率范围内进行，以研究Na离子在电解质中的扩散和通过SEI的迁移以及电荷通过SEI的迁移和在电极中的扩散。图5d显示了在循环期间放电到0.1 V后SSDC电极的奈奎斯特图。**有趣的是，即使经过30次充/放电循环后，其阻抗仍约为108Ω，阻抗仍显示出微不足道的变化，这表明电极在循环过程中具有稳定性**。另一方面，在SBDC电极的奈奎斯特图中，阻抗特别是中频区域中的半圆在循环过程中急剧增加，这表明循环期间界面电阻增加，这可能是SBDC电极表现出很大的原因。性能较差（图S11）。界面电阻的这种增加可能归因于SBDC的短π共轭体系，这导致较低的电荷传输和稳定性。从这些分析中，**我们认为SSDC电极的高容量和高可循环性可能是由于扩展的π共轭体系所致，因为它可以：（1）改善电荷传输并稳定充电和放电状态，以及（2）增强表面活性。分子间的相互作用和由此产生的梯形堆积结构促进了Na离子的插入/提取。应该注意的是，SSDC还显示出比具有碳-碳单键连接的材料（16）更好的高倍率性能，这再次证明了在高倍率性能下扩展π共轭体系的效率。**

## Conclusions
In summary, we reasonably designed SSDC for SIBs, through the molecular design to appropriately extend the π-conjugated system for improving the battery performance and addressing the current challenge of fast-charge and -discharge. As expected, the extension of the π-conjugated system was proved to be an efficient method for improving the electrochemical performance, delivering a reversible capacity of 220 mAh g–1 under current density of 50 mA g–1. This capacity is among the highest values for both organic Li- and Na-ion batteries. Remarkably, the designed electrodes showed much enhanced high rate performance with reversible capacities of 105 mAh g–1 at current density of 2 A g–1 and 72 mAh g–1 at current density as high as 10 A g–1, which is much better than the starting molecule and superior in organic SIBs. The capacity also can be fully recovered even after cycled at rate as high as 10 A g–1. The cyclability performance under high current density of 1 A g–1 showed that the capacity is still higher than 112 mAh g–1 even after 400 cycles with retention higher than 70%. These results suggest that the extension of π-conjugated system is an efficient strategy to improve the high rate performance, probably because it can: (1) improve the charge transport and stabilize the charged and discharged states and (2) enhance the intermolecular interactions and the resulted terrace packing structure can facilitate the insertion/extraction of the Na-ions. We believe this work will arouse growing interests of organic materials for SIBs with functional molecular design toward high performance and pave a way to achieve flexible application of SIBs in large-scale portable and wearable electronics.  
总而言之，我们通过分子设计合理设计了用于SIB的SSDC，以适当扩展π共轭体系，以改善电池性能并解决当前的快速充电和放电难题。如预期的那样，π共轭体系的扩展被证明是一种改善电化学性能的有效方法，在50 mA g-1的电流密度下可提供220 mAh g-1的可逆容量。该容量是有机锂离子电池和钠离子电池的最高容量之一。值得注意的是，设计的电极显示出更高的高倍率性能，电流密度为2 A g-1时可逆容量为105 mAh g-1，电流密度高达10 A g-1时可逆容量为72 mAh g-1。比起始分子更好，并且在有机SIB中更胜一筹。即使以高达10 A g-1的速率循环后，容量也可以完全恢复。在1 A g–1的高电流密度下的循环性能表明，即使经过400次循环，其保持率仍高于70％，容量仍高于112 mAh g–1。这些结果表明，π共轭体系的扩展是提高高倍率性能的有效策略，可能是因为它可以：（1）改善电荷传输并稳定充电和放电状态，以及（2）增强分子间的相互作用，以及所得的阶梯堆积结构可以促进Na离子的插入/提取。我们相信这项工作将引起功能分子设计的SIB有机材料对高性能的日益增长的兴趣，并为在大型便携式和可穿戴电子产品中实现SIB的灵活应用铺平道路。
