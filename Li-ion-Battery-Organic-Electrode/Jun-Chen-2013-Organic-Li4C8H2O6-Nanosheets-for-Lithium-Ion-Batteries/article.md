Organic tetralithium salts of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (Li4C8H2O6) with the morphologies of bulk, nanoparticles, and nanosheets have been investigated as the active materials of either positive or negative electrode of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. It is demonstrated that, in the electrolyte of LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), reversible two-Li-ion electrochemical reactions are taking place with redox Li4C8H2O6/Li2C8H2O6 at ∼2.6 V for a positive electrode and Li4C8H2O6/Li6C8H2O6 at ∼0.8 V for a negative electrode, respectively. In the observed system, the electrochemical performance of high to low order is nanosheets > nanoparticles > bulk. Remarkably, Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets show the discharge capacities of 223 and 145 mAh g–1 at 0.1 and 5 C rates, respectively. A capacity retention of 95% is sustained after 50 cycles at 0.1 C rate charge/discharge and room temperature. Moreover, charging the symmetrical cells with Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets as the initial active materials of both positive and negative electrodes produces all-organic LIBs with an average operation voltage of 1.8 V and an energy density of about 130 Wh kg–1, enlightening the design and application of organic Li-reservoir compounds with nanostructures for all organic LIBs.  
已经研究了具有块状，纳米颗粒和纳米片形态的2，5-二羟基对苯二甲酸的有机四锂盐（Li4C8H2O6）作为可再充电锂离子电池正极或负极的活性材料。结果表明，在溶解于碳酸亚乙酯（EC）和碳酸二甲酯（DMC）中的LiPF6电解液中，可逆的两锂离子电化学反应是通过氧化还原Li4C8H2O6 / Li2C8H2O6在约2.6 V的正极上和Li4C8H2O6 / Li6C8H2O6在约0.8 V的负极进行的。在观察到的系统中，从高到低的电化学性能是纳米片>纳米颗粒>块状。值得注意的是，Li4C8H2O6纳米片在0.1和5 C速率下的放电容量分别为223和145 mAh g-1。在0.1 C速率充电/放电和室温下进行50次循环后，容量保持率保持在95％。此外，用Li4C8H2O6纳米片作为正极和负极的初始活性材料对对称电池充电，可以产生平均工作电压为1.8 V，能量密度约为130 Wh kg-1的全有机LIB，从而启发了设计和应用所有有机LIB具有纳米结构的有机锂储库化合物。

## Main
Organic molecules as electrode materials of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have captured worldwide attention because of their high capacities, molecular controllability, structural diversity, and resource renewability.(1-3) Exciting progress has been made on organic electrode materials for LIBs, including organic free radical compounds,(4-6) organosulfur compounds,(7, 8) and organic carbonyl compounds.(9-16) However, one of the most critical issues related to the utilization of organic electrode materials is their high solubility in aprotic electrolytes commonly used in the LIBs. Among various strategies to address the problem, using lithium salts of organic molecules is very effective for inhibiting the dissolution of organic electrode materials in aprotic electrolytes.(17-20) It is found that lithium dicarboxylate (Li2C8H4O4) delivered 234 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles with a potential plateau of 0.8 V at the current density of 15 mA g–1, which is about 78% of the theoretical capacity (301 mAh g–1).(18) Meanwhile, ethoxycarbonyl-based lithium salt (Li2C18H12O8) showed the capacity of 125 mAh g–1 in the first cycle and ∼110 mAh g–1 in the 50th cycle over two voltage plateaus at ∼1.96 and 1.65 V.(19) More interestingly, a tetralithium salt of tetrahydroxybenzoquinone (Li4C6O6) was reduced to Li6C6O6 at 1.8 V and oxidized to Li2C6O6 at 2.7 V with a reversible capacity of ∼200 mAh g–1.(17, 20) This battery system however shows low output voltage (∼1 V) but clearly reveals that using the lithiated (or Li-reservoir) oxocarbon salt is feasible to construct all-organic symmetrical rechargeable LIBs. Following a similar concept, a few particularly designed lithiated compounds such as a lithiated naphthazarin unit and 3,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone dilithium (Li2DHDMQ) reacted at a ∼3 V potential range but exhibited relatively low capacity (∼125 mAh g–1) and high polarization.(21, 22) Thus, there is plenty of room to develop organic Li-reservoir compounds for all-organic LIBs with improved performance such as high-output voltage, high capacity, and long cycle life.  
作为可充电锂离子电池（LIB）的电极材料的有机分子，由于其高容量，分子可控性，结构多样性和资源可再生性而引起了全世界的关注。（1-3）用于LIB的有机电极材料取得了令人激动的进展包括有机自由基化合物，（4-6）有机硫化合物，（7、8）和有机羰基化合物。（9-16）但是，与利用有机电极材料有关的最关键问题之一是它们的高溶解性在LIB中常用的非质子电解质中在解决该问题的各种策略中，使用有机分子的锂盐对于抑制有机电极材料在非质子电解质中的溶解非常有效。（17-20）发现，二羧酸锂（Li2C8H4O4）在放电后可输送234 mAh g–1在电流密度为15 mA g-1的情况下进行50次循环，电位平稳为0.8 V，约为理论容量（301 mAh g-1）的78％。（18）同时，乙氧羰基锂盐（Li2C18H12O8）在约1.96 V和1.65 V的两个电压平稳期间，在第一个循环中显示的容量为125 mAh g-1，在第50个循环中显示的容量为约110 mAh g-1。（19）更有趣的是，四羟基苯醌的四锂盐（Li4C6O6）为在1.8 V电压下还原为Li6C6O6，在2.7 V电压下氧化为Li2C6O6，可逆容量约为200 mAh g–1。（17，20）该电池系统显示出低输出电压（〜1 V），但清楚地表明，使用锂离子电池（或锂储层）含氧碳盐可用于构造ruct全有机对称可充电LIB。遵循类似的概念，一些经过特殊设计的锂化化合物，例如锂化的萘他林单元和3,6-二羟基-2,5-二甲氧基-对苯醌二锂（Li2DHDMQ）在〜3 V电位范围内反应，但显示出相对较低的容量（〜125 mAh g–1）和高极化。（21，22）因此，有足够的空间来开发用于全有机LIB的有机锂储库化合物，并具有更高的性能，例如高输出电压，高容量和高稳定性。循环寿命长。

Recently, nanostructures and nanocomposites of organic conducting polymers have been investigated in energy storage fields such as batteries and supercapacitors because of their numerous active sites and facile electronic/ionic transfer and diffusion.(23-25) Shifting from bulk to nanostructured electrode materials could offer the opportunity to develop advanced green batteries with large capacity, high energy and power density, high efficiency, and long cycle life.(26) Therefore, the combination of lithiated organic molecules and nanostructures will be of importance for developing all-organic LIBs with high performance.  
近年来，由于其众多的活性位点以及便捷的电子/离子转移和扩散，已在诸如电池和超级电容器等储能领域研究了有机导电聚合物的纳米结构和纳米复合材料。（23-25）从本体电极向纳米结构电极材料的转变可以提供有机会开发大容量，高能量和功率密度，高效率和长循环寿命的高级绿色电池。（26）因此，锂化有机分子和纳米结构的结合对于开发高性能有机锂电池至关重要。

In this Letter, we systematically studied the electrochemical performance of organic tetralithium salts of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (Li4C8H2O6, Li4DHTPA) with the morphologies of bulk, nanoparticles, and nanosheets. It is demonstrated that with normal LiPF6-ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, reversible two-Li-ion electrochemical reactions occur with redox couples of Li4C8H2O6/Li2C8H2O6 in the positive electrode and Li4C8H2O6/Li6C8H2O6 in the negative electrode, respectively (Scheme 1). With three morphologies of Li4C8H2O6 as the active materials of either positive or negative electrode, nanosheets showed the best electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 223 mAh g–1 and a capacity retention exceeding 95% after 50 cycles at 0.1 C rate. Furthermore, two redox couples of Li4C8H2O6/Li2C8H2O6 and Li4C8H2O6/Li6C8H2O6 with the starting Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets as both the positive and negative electrodes enable the obtaining of all-organic LIBs with remarkable performance such as high working voltage (1.8 V) and high capacity retention (91% capacity retention after 20 cycles).  
在这封信中，我们系统地研究了2,5-二羟基对苯二甲酸的有机四锂盐（Li4C8H2O6，Li4DHTPA）的电化学性能，具有本体，纳米颗粒和纳米片的形态。结果表明，在普通的LiPF6-碳酸亚乙酯-碳酸二甲酯电解质中，正极的Li4C8H2O6 /Li2C8H2O6和负极的Li4C8H2O6 /Li6C8H2O6的氧化还原对发生可逆的两锂离子电化学反应（方案1）。以三种形态的Li4C8H2O6作为正极或负极的活性材料，纳米片表现出最佳的电化学性能，其初始放电容量为223 mAh g-1，在0.1 C速率下经过50次循环后，容量保持率超过95％。此外，Li4C8H2O6 /Li2C8H2O6和Li4C8H2O6 /Li6C8H2O6的两个氧化还原对与起始的Li4C8H2O6纳米片作为正电极和负电极均可实现具有出色性能（例如高工作电压（1.8 V）和高容量保持率的全有机LIB的获得， 20个循环后保持91％的容量）。

Scheme 1. Structures and Electrochemical Redox Reactions between Li4C8H2O6 (Li4DHTPA) and Li2C8H2O6 (Li2DHTPA)/Li6C8H2O6 (Li6DHTPA)

Details of the preparation of Li4C8H2O6 bulk, nanoparticles, and nanosheets are described in Supporting Information (SI). In brief, Li4C8H2O6 bulk was synthesized by a simple reaction of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DHTPA) with lithium methoxide in methanol solution (Scheme S1).(27) Li4C8H2O6 nanoparticles with the size of ∼50–200 nm were prepared by ball-milling the mixture of bulk Li4C8H2O6 and carbon black in argon atmosphere. Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets with the thickness of several nanometers were obtained with the ultrasonic exfoliation of the corresponding bulk. Elemental analysis, IR, NMR, MS, and XRD (Table S1 and Figure S1–S4) clearly illustrate the formation of tetralithium salt (Li4DHTPA, Li4C8H2O6) from DHTPA. The tetralithium salt couples conjugated enolate and carboxylate groups at two para positions of one benzene ring. The electron donation effect of enolate sites and the electron delocalization capability of carboxylate groups in Li4C8H2O6 contribute synergistically to the positive shift of delithiation potential and the negative shift of lithiation potential, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals the thermal stability of Li4C8H2O6 up to 300 °C in Ar atmosphere (Figure S5), which is believed to be a key factor concerning the safety of LIBs.  
Li4C8H2O6块体，纳米颗粒和纳米片的制备细节在支持信息（SI）中进行了描述。简而言之，通过在甲醇溶液中将2,5-二羟基对苯二甲酸（DHTPA）与甲醇锂简单反应合成了Li4C8H2O6（方案S1）。（27）用球制备了大小约为50-200 nm的Li4C8H2O6纳米颗粒。在氩气气氛中研磨块状Li4C8H2O6和炭黑的混合物。通过超声剥离相应的块状物，获得了厚度为几纳米的Li4C8H2O6纳米片。元素分析，IR，NMR，MS和XRD（表S1和图S1-S4）清楚地说明了DHTPA形成了四锂盐（Li4DHTPA，Li4C8H2O6）。四锂盐在一个苯环的两个对位偶合共轭的烯酸酯和羧酸酯基团。 Li 4 C 8 H 2 O 6中的烯醇化位点的电子给予作用和羧酸酯基团的电子离域能力分别协同作用于脱锂电势的正向移动和锂化电势的负向移动。热重分析表明，在Ar气氛中，Li4C8H2O6在高达300°C的温度下具有热稳定性（图S5），这被认为是影响LIB安全性的关键因素。

The as-synthesized bulk Li4C8H2O6 is in the form of pale yellow powders with lamellar morphology, and the average particle size is in the micrometer range (Figure 1a). After ball milling, Li4C8H2O6 exhibits the agglomeration of irregular nanoparticles with diameters of ∼50–200 nm (Figure 1b). After ultrasonication exfoliation, the lamellar bulk Li4C8H2O6 is exfoliated to highly dispersed nanosheets (Figure 1c), which is further confirmed by TEM image (Figure 1d). The nanosheets are characteristic of interweave structure with several nanometers thickness of each sheet (inset of Figure 1d). It is found that the exfoliation of Li4C8H2O6 bulk in higher protic solvents such as in methanol rather than in ethanol or diethyl ether is better to obtain the nanosheets. Both the ultrasonic dispersion effect and the interaction (e.g., solvent molecule coordination to lithium-ion) between tetralithium salt and solvent molecule methanol play the important role in the formation of nanosheets. The specific surface areas of Li4C8H2O6 bulk, nanoparticles, and nanosheets were measured to be 20.4, 109.2, and 118.7 m2 g–1, respectively (Figure S6).  
刚合成的块状Li4C8H2O6为淡黄色粉末，具有层状形态，平均粒径在微米范围内（图1a）。球磨后，Li4C8H2O6呈现出直径约50-200 nm的不规则纳米颗粒的团聚（图1b）。**超声剥落后，层状块状Li4C8H2O6剥落成高度分散的纳米片（图1c），这可以通过TEM图像进一步确认（图1d）。纳米片是交织结构的特征，每片厚度为几纳米（图1d的插图）。发现在较高质子溶剂如甲醇中而不是在乙醇或二乙醚中，Li4C8H2O6主体的剥离更好地获得了纳米片。** 超声分散效应和四锂盐与溶剂分子甲醇之间的相互作用（例如，溶剂分子与锂离子配位）在纳米片的形成中起重要作用。 Li4C8H2O6块，纳米颗粒和纳米片的比表面积分别为20.4、109.2和118.7 m2 g-1（图S6）。

Electrochemical performance of Li4C8H2O6 bulk, nanoparticles, and nanosheets was investigated using coin-type cells assembled with Li counter electrode and LiPF6-EC-DMC electrolyte (electrochemical measurements, SI). The open-circuit voltages of all fabricated cells are close to 2.4 V. To illustrate the two conjugated enolate and carboxylate functional groups in Li4C8H2O6, the cells were tested in two voltage ranges of 1.8–3.2 V (for positive electrode) and 0.4–2.0 V (for negative electrode). The electrochemical performance of the cells with Li4C8H2O6 bulk, nanoparticles, and nanosheets is shown in Figure S7, Figure S8, and Figure 2, respectively. The electrochemical test demonstrates that Li4C8H2O6 bulk, nanoparticles and nanosheets can reversibly delithiate at ∼2.6 V and lithiate at ∼0.8 V with two Li per formula unit, respectively. The overall performance from high to low follows the order of nanosheets > nanoparticles > bulk.  
使用组装有Li对电极和LiPF6-EC-DMC电解质的纽扣型电池，研究Li4C8H2O6本体，纳米颗粒和纳米片的电化学性能（电化学测量，SI）。**所有组装电池的开路电压均接近2.4V。为说明Li4C8H2O6中的两个共轭烯酸酯和羧酸官能团，在1.8–3.2 V（用于正极）和0.4–2.0V（负极）的两个电压范围内对电池进行了测试。** 具有Li4C8H2O6块，纳米颗粒和纳米片的电池的电化学性能分别显示在图S7，图S8和图2中。电化学测试表明，**Li4C8H2O6本体，纳米颗粒和纳米片可在约2.6 V时可逆脱锂，在约0.8 V时可锂化，每个配方单元含两个Li。从高到低的总体性能遵循纳米片>纳米颗粒>体积的顺序。**

Figure 2a shows the typical galvanostatic charge and discharge profiles of the cells with Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets cycled between 1.8 and 3.2 V. The first charge (Li4C8H2O6 to Li2C8H2O6) and discharge (Li2C8H2O6 to Li4C8H2O6) capacities were 226 and 223 mAh g–1, respectively. The measured capacities are about 93% of the theoretical value (241 mAh g–1), of which 95% was kept after 50 cycles. In addition to high capacity retention, the Coulombic efficiency is close to 99.9% (Figure 2b). In comparison, the first charge and discharge capacities for Li4C8H2O6 bulk were 148 and 145 mAh g–1, with capacity retention of 94% after 50 cycles (Figure S7). The nanoparticles outperformed the bulk sample but were slightly inferior to the nanosheets in reversible capacities (Figure S8). The rate capability of Li4C8H2O6 bulk and nanosheets was measured (Figure 2c). At a high rate of 5 C, Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets display the discharge capacity of 145 mAh g–1, which is about 7 times of that for Li4C8H2O6 bulk (20 mAh g–1). Cyclic voltammograms (CV) (inset of Figure 2a) show that, in the initial anodic and cathodic sweeping, only one sharp oxidation peak at 2.7 V and a pair of reduction peaks at 2.6 and 2.35 V were observed with a nearly equivalent integral area of redox peaks. Meanwhile, in the following cycle, two pairs of redox peaks emerge, which is in good agreement with the charge/discharge profiles. The initial anodic peak can be regarded as an activation process for Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets. The subsequent two redox pairs illustrate 2 × 1e reactions, as shown in the right part of Scheme 1. The observed small transition peak can be viewed as an overlay of the two distinctive peaks, suggesting that the two stepwise redox reactions proceed simultaneously to some extent.  
图2a显示了Li4C8H2O6纳米片在1.8和3.2 V之间循环的典型恒电流充放电曲线。第一次充电（Li4C8H2O6到Li2C8H2O6）和放电（Li2C8H2O6到Li4C8H2O6）的容量分别为226和223 mAh g-1。测得的容量约为理论值（241 mAh g–1）的93％，其中50％经过50次循环后得以保留。除了高容量保持能力外，库仑效率接近99.9％（图2b）。相比之下，Li4C8H2O6的首次充放电容量为148和145 mAh g-1，经过50个循环后容量保持率为94％（图S7）。纳米粒子的性能优于整体样品，但可逆容量略逊于纳米片（图S8）。测量了Li4C8H2O6块和纳米片的速率能力（图2c）。在5 C的高速率下，Li4C8H2O6纳米片的放电容量为145 mAh g-1，约为Li4C8H2O6整体放电容量（20 mAh g-1）的7倍。循环伏安图（CV）（图2a的插图）显示，在初始的阳极和阴极扫描中， 在2.7 V处仅观察到一个尖锐的氧化峰，在2.6和2.35 V处观察到一对还原峰，氧化还原峰的积分面积几乎相等。同时，在接下来的循环中，出现了两对氧化还原峰，这与充电/放电曲线非常吻合。初始阳极峰可被视为Li4C8H2O6纳米片的活化过程。随后的两个氧化还原对说明了2×1e反应，如方案1的右侧所示。观察到的小跃迁峰可以看作是两个独特峰的叠加，表明这两个逐步氧化还原反应在一定程度上同时进行。

Figure 2d shows the typical discharge and charge curves of the cells with Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets cycled in the voltage range of 0.4 and 2.0 V. In this case, the cells were first discharged and then charged. The average discharge and charge plateaus of the cells are around 0.8 and 1.0 V, respectively. The first discharge capacity was 358 mAh g–1, while the subsequent charge capacity was 254 mAh g–1. This initial low Coulombic efficiency (∼71%) is due to the irreversible capacity arising from the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is a common character for anode materials of LIBs at the first cycle.(28) In the low potential range (inset of Figure 2d), there is one reduction peak centered at 0.7 V and one oxidation peak at 1.0 V. In the following cycle, the reduction peak becomes more symmetrical and shifts to a slightly positive potential (0.8 V) with a lower integral area, while the oxidation peak is essentially preserved. The difference between the first and the second cycle can be ascribed to the formation of SEI. The CVs in the low potential range of 0.4 to 2.0 V show only one redox pair (inset of Figure 2d), which is dissimilar to that in the high potential region of 1.8–3.2 V (inset of Figure 2a). This implies a fast transformation from molecular Li4C8H2O6 to radical anion (Li+[Li4C8H2O6]−•) and dianion (Li22+[Li4C8H2O6]2–) or a direct 2e-transfer redox reaction. A direct 2e process is more feasible as can be thermodynamically predicted from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations presented later.  
图2d显示了Li4C8H2O6纳米片在0.4和2.0 V电压范围内循环的电池的典型放电和充电曲线。在这种情况下，首先放电，然后充电。电池的平均放电平稳期和​​充电平稳期分别约为0.8 V和1.0V。第一次放电容量为358 mAh g-1，随后的充电容量为254 mAh g-1。最初的低库仑效率（〜71％）是由于形成固体电解质中间相（SEI）而产生的不可逆容量，这是LIB负极材料在第一个循环中的共同特征。（28）在低电势下范围（图2d的插图），有一个以0.7 V为中心的还原峰和一个以1.0 V为中心的氧化峰。在随后的循环中，还原峰变得更加对称，并转移到稍低的正电势（0.8 V）积分面积，而氧化峰基本上得以保留。第一和第二循环之间的差异可归因于SEI的形成。在0.4至2.0 V的低电势范围内的CV仅显示一对氧化还原（图2d的插图），这与在1.8-3.2 V的高电势区域（图2a的插图）不同。这意味着从分子Li4C8H2O6快速转变为自由基阴离子（Li + [Li4C8H2O6]-•）和二价阴离子（Li22 + [Li4C8H2O6] 2-）或直接2e转移氧化还原反应。直接2e过程更可行，因为可以从稍后介绍的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算中进行热力学预测。

After 50 cycles, the capacity of 232 mAh g–1 was retained for Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets (Figure 2e). The common reasons for such fading include structural/morphological material changes on cycling or material solubility issue, although we did not observe any discoloration on dismantling the cell (Figure S9). It is noted that the conducting carbon additive (20 wt %) contributes partially to the total capacity of the electrode cycled below 1.5 V but negligibly above 1.8 V (Figure S10). By subtracting this contribution, the reversible capacity between Li4C8H2O6 and Li6C8H2O6 approaches the theoretical data of 241 mAh g–1, corresponding to two Li+ reactions as shown in the left part of Scheme 1. The rate capability of Li4C8H2O6 bulk and nanosheets was also measured (Figure 2f). At a high rate of 5C, Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets show the discharge capacity of ∼175 mAh g–1, which is much higher than that of Li4C8H2O6 bulk (80 mAh g–1). Thus, either as the positive electrode or as the negative electrode, Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets exhibit a greatly improved rate capability than that of the bulk. The superior performance can be understood from the beneficial factors that 2D nanosheets provide shorter Li+ diffusion paths and large contact areas both for the conducting agent and for the electrolyte. Notably, any morphology of Li4C8H2O6 shows a better rate capability in the negative electrode than that in the positive electrode. Furthermore, since only 20% carbon additive is added in the negative electrode while 30% carbon additive is used in the positive electrode, such a difference is not because of the carbon additive but because of the electronic states of the organic molecules during the cathodic and anodic processes, as illustrated by theoretical modeling calculations later.  
经过50个循环后，Li4C8H2O6纳米片的容量为232 mAh g-1（图2e）。这种褪色的常见原因包括循环或材料溶解度问题引起的结构/形态材料变化，尽管我们在拆解电池时未观察到任何变色现象（图S9）。**应当指出，导电碳添加剂（20 wt％）部分地影响了在低于1.5 V循环但高于1.8 V时可忽略不计的电极的总容量（图S10）。** 通过减去此贡献，Li4C8H2O6和Li6C8H2O6之间的可逆容量接近理论值241 mAh g–1，对应于方案1左侧所示的两个Li +反应。还测量了Li4C8H2O6本体和纳米片的速率能力（图2f）。在高5C速率下，Li4C8H2O6纳米片的放电容量约为175 mAh g-1，远高于整体Li4C8H2O6的放电容量（80 mAh g-1）。因此，无论是作为正极还是作为负极，Li4C8H2O6纳米片均显示出比块体大得多的倍率能力。从有利的因素可以理解出优越的性能，即二维纳米片为导电剂和电解质提供了较短的Li +扩散路径和较大的接触面积。值得注意的是，Li4C8H2O6的任何形态在负极中显示出比正极中更好的速率能力。此外，由于仅在负极中添加了20％的碳添加剂，而在正极中使用了30％的碳添加剂，所以这种差异不是由于碳添加剂，而是由于在阴极和阴极期间有机分子的电子态。阳极过程，如稍后的理论模型计算所示。

To gain insight into the structural evolution of Li4C8H2O6, we performed infrared (IR) spectra and Raman spectroscopic analysis of the electrode on cycling within the full potential window of 0.4–3.2 V (spectroscopic study, SI). Well-defined plateaus can be observed both above 2.3 V and below 1 V with a low potential gap around 0.2 V (Figure 3a). Ex situ IR spectra were recorded for the fully charged and discharged samples that are recovered from the dismantled cells (Figure 3b). The IR spectra for the electrode at initial 2.3 V (point A), discharged 1.8 V (point C), and charged 2.0 V (point E) are reminiscent of that for the as-made Li4C8H2O6 (Figure S1). The strong vibrations centered at around 1231 and 1585 cm–1 are assigned to ═C–O stretching mode of phenolic groups and C═O stretching mode of carboxylate groups, respectively. The peak at low frequency of ∼565 cm–1 is attributed to COO–Li out-plane bending vibration. At fully charged 3.2 V (point B), the phenolic-oxygen signal disappears, while the vibration at 1630 cm–1 indicates the presence of quinonoid carbonyl group. At fully discharged 0.4 V (point D), the carboxylate carbonyl vibration is not distinguishable while the enolate vibration remains. Inspecting the disparity in representative infrared data reveals redox reactions of enolate/quinonoid carbonyl couple at high potentials and carboxylate/enolate couple at low potentials.  
为了深入了解Li4C8H2O6的结构演变，我们对电极进行了红外（IR）光谱和拉曼光谱分析，并在0.4-3.2 V的完整电势窗口内进行了循环（光谱研究，SI）。在高于2.3 V和低于1 V的情况下都可以观察到明确定义的平稳期，并且在0.2 V附近具有较低的电位间隙（图3a）。记录了从已拆除电池回收的充满电和放电的样品的异位红外光谱（图3b）。电极在初始2.3 V（A点），放电1.8 V（C点）和充电2.0 V（E点）时的红外光谱让人联想到制成的Li4C8H2O6（图S1）。中心在1231和1585 cm-1附近的强烈振动分别被赋予酚基团的═C-O拉伸模式和羧酸酯基团的C═O拉伸模式。低频处约565 cm-1的峰值归因于COO-Li平面外弯曲振动。在充满电的3.2 V（B点）下，酚氧信号消失，而在1630 cm-1处的振动表明存在醌型羰基。在完全放电的0.4 V（点D）下，羧酸盐羰基振动无法分辨，而烯醇盐振动仍然存在。检查代表性红外数据中的差异，发现烯醇盐/醌类羰基对在高电势下和羧酸盐/烯醇盐对在低电势下的氧化还原反应。

An in situ Raman technique was carried out to monitor the cycling process of Li4C8H2O6 (Scheme S2). Figure 3c–d shows a series of selected in situ data collected at high potential range (from 2.4 to 3.2 V for charge and from 3.1 to 2.3 V for discharge) and at low potential range (from 2.3 to 0.4 V for discharge and from 0.7 to 2.0 V for charge), respectively. Strong peaks due to electrolyte and carbon additive are also detected in the spectra, masking some of the characteristic signals. Fortunately, it is easy to discern Raman shifts at 634 and 1216 cm–1, which correspond to the out-plane bending of COO–Li and the symmetrical stretching of ═C–O, respectively. At 2.3–3.2 V, the carboxylate group vibrations are preserved, while the enolate group peaks are gradually weakened on charging, but this is enhanced on discharging. In comparison, the carboxylate intensity gradually declines within the low potential region of 0.4–2.3 V. It is noted that all Raman intensities decrease at the plateau region of 0.4–0.9 V. The weakened vibrations at low potentials are ascribed to an increase in structural symmetry and electrical conductivity of the Li-rich materials.(29) Thus, the combination of IR and Raman spectral changes during the charge and discharge confirms the material evolution of Li4C8H2O6: the formation of Li2C8H2O6 on full charging and the generation of Li6C8H2O6 upon full discharging.  
进行了原位拉曼技术以监测Li4C8H2O6的循环过程（方案S2）。图3c–d显示了一系列在高电势范围（充电时为2.4至3.2 V，放电时为3.1至2.3 V）和低电势范围（放电时为2.3至0.4 V，而从0.7时采集的一系列现场数据充电至2.0 V）。在光谱中还检测到由于电解质和碳添加剂引起的强峰，从而掩盖了某些特征信号。幸运的是，很容易辨别出在634和1216 cm-1处的拉曼位移，分别对应于COO-Li的平面外弯曲和═C-O的对称拉伸。在2.3–3.2 V时，羧酸酯基团的振动得以保留，而烯醇酯基团的峰在充电时逐渐减弱，但在放电时增强。相比之下，羧酸盐强度在0.4-2.3 V的低电势区域内逐渐下降。应注意的是，所有拉曼强度在0.4-0.9 V的高原区域均下降。在低电势下减弱的振动归因于结构的增加富锂材料的对称性和导电性。（29）因此，在充电和放电过程中IR和拉曼光谱变化的组合证实了Li4C8H2O6的材料演化：完全充电时形成Li2C8H2O6和完全充电时生成Li6C8H2O6放电。

DFT calculations were further carried out to understand the energy level of Li2C8H2O6, Li4C8H2O6, and Li6C8H2O6 (computational details, SI). The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) plots (Figure 4a) show that the anions of Li4C8H2O6 and the corresponding oxidized and reduced compounds are structurally stable with effective electron delocalization and conjugation. This should result in the high utilization of the active sites.(14) The anions could be further stabilized with Li coordination to form the corresponding salts.(12) Moreover, the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO energy levels reflect the difference in vertical electron affinity (VEA) and vertical ionization potential (VIP) of Li2C8H2O6, Li4C8H2O6, and Li6C8H2O6 (Figure 4b). The energy level of the molecules indicates their oxidizability and reducibility, which coincides with the experimentally determined redox potentials (i.e., 2.6 vs 2.73 V and 0.8 vs 0.61 V from Tables S2 and S3).(10) The flexible electronic structure along with the insolubility (or extremely low solubility) of tetrelithium salt (Li4C8H2O6) in organic electrolyte (Figure S9) accounts for the prominent reversibility of Li4C8H2O6-based electrode.  
进一步进行DFT计算以了解Li2C8H2O6，Li4C8H2O6和Li6C8H2O6的能级（计算详细信息，SI）。最高占据分子轨道（HOMO）图（图4a）显示Li4C8H2O6的阴离子以及相应的氧化和还原的化合物在结构上稳定，具有有效的电子离域和共轭作用。这应该导致活性位点的高利用率。（14）可以通过Li配位进一步稳定阴离子以形成相应的盐。（12）此外，计算得出的最低未占据分子轨道（LUMO）和HOMO能级反映了Li2C8H2O6，Li4C8H2O6和Li6C8H2O6的垂直电子亲和力（VEA）和垂直电离电势（VIP）的差异（图4b）。分子的能级指示其氧化性和还原性，这与实验确定的氧化还原电位（即表S2和S3的2.6对2.73 V和0.8对0.61 V）相符。（10）柔性电子结构以及不溶性四锂盐（Li4C8H2O6）在有机电解质中的溶解度（或极低的溶解度）（图S9）说明了Li4C8H2O6基电极的突出可逆性。

It should be noted that, in the low potential region of 0.4–2.0 V, there is a large difference between the redox energies of Li4DHTPA/Li5DHTPA and Li5DHTPA/Li6DHTPA, while in the high potential region of 1.8–3.2 V, the redox energies of Li2DHTPA/Li3DHTPA and Li3DHTPA/Li4DHTPA are very close (Table S4). These results illustrate that one two-electron redox process within 0.4–2.0 V and two one-electron redox processes within 1.8–3.2 V are occurring, which are consistent with the CVs in the insets of Figure 2a and d. Furthermore, Li2C8H2O6 has a higher Eg value (LUMO–HOMO gap, a higher Eg implies a lower electric conductivity) and lower structure symmetry than that of Li6C8H2O6, which is feasibly the cause of the weaker spectroscopic signal of Li6C8H2O6. This lower electric conductivity of Li2C8H2O6 also explains the need of more conducting carbon additive for the positive electrode cycled at a high potential window.  
应该注意的是，在0.4-2.0 V的低电势区域中，Li4DHTPA /Li5DHTPA和Li5DHTPA /Li6DHTPA的氧化还原能量之间存在很大差异，而在1.8-3.2 V的高电势区域中，氧化还原能量Li2DHTPA /Li3DHTPA和Li3DHTPA /Li4DHTPA的关系非常接近（表S4）。这些结果说明，正在发生0.4-2.0 V范围内的一个二电子氧化还原过程和1.8-3.2 V范围内的两个单电子氧化还原过程，这与图2a和d中插图中的CV一致。此外，与Li6C8H2O6相比，Li2C8H2O6具有更高的Eg值（LUMO-HOMO间隙，更高的Eg意味着更低的电导率）和更低的结构对称性，这可能是Li6C8H2O6光谱信号较弱的原因。 Li2C8H2O6的这种较低的电导率还解释了对于在高电势窗口处循环的正极需要更多导电碳添加剂的需求。

The considerable electrode capacity and cycleability of reversible electrochemical reactions of Li4C8H2O6/Li2C8H2O6 and Li4C8H2O6/Li6C8H2O6 stimulates the assembly of coin-type symmetrical cells. Figure 5 shows the typical cell performance with Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets as the initial active materials of both the positive and negative electrodes. As expected, the fabricated cells without any charging or discharging display open-circuit voltages near zero. However, the first charging to 2.7 V and the subsequent discharging to 1 V at 0.2 C (48.2 mA g–1) exhibit the capacities of 225 and 208 mAh g–1, respectively, which are based on the active mass of the negative electrode. The following galvanostatic charge–discharge curves show a similar sloping shape (Figure 5a). After 20 cycles of charge/discharge at 48.2 mA g–1, 91% of the cell capacity was sustained. The Coulombic efficiency is around 99.7% (Figure 5b). Notably, the average discharge voltage of the cell is about 1.8 V. Although this voltage is still lower than that of inorganic LiCoO2/C or LiFePO4/C LIBs, Li4C8H2O6 features the merits of resource abundance, high reversible capacity (at 200 mAh g–1 level) and structural robustness.(30) The energy density of the as-assembled cell is about 130 Wh kg–1 based on the total weight of both positive and negative electrodes with that the performance improvement is still ongoing. In this regard, Li4C8H2O6 is promising for the construction of all organic rechargeable LIBs.  
Li4C8H2O6 /Li2C8H2O6和Li4C8H2O6 /Li6C8H2O6的可逆电化学反应的可观电极容量和循环能力刺激了硬币型对称电池的组装。图5显示了Li4C8H2O6纳米片作为正极和负极的初始活性材料时的典型电池性能。如预期的那样，没有进行任何充电或放电的装配电池显示的开路电压接近零。但是，第一次充电至2.7 V，随后在0.2 C（48.2 mA g-1）下放电至1 V，分别表现出225和208 mAh g-1的容量，这取决于负极的活性物质。以下恒电流充放电曲线显示出类似的倾斜形状（图5a）。在48.2 mA g–1下进行20个充电/放电循环后，电池容量保持了91％。库仑效率约为99.7％（图5b）。值得注意的是，电池的平均放电电压约为1.8V。尽管该电压仍低于无机LiCoO2 /C或LiFePO4 /C LIB，但Li4C8H2O6具有资源丰富，可逆容量高（200 mAh g– （1级）和结构坚固性。（30）组装后的电池的能量密度约为130 Wh kg-1，基于正极和负极的总重量，性能仍在不断提高。在这方面，Li4C8H2O6有望用于所有有机可充电LIB的构造。

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we have systematically studied the electrochemical performance of organic tetralithium salts of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (Li4C8H2O6) with the morphologies of bulk, nanoparticles and nanosheets. The dissolution of Li4C8H2O6 in the EC/DEC electrolyte is extremely low. A combination of electrochemical investigation, DFT modeling, ex situ infrared study, and in situ Raman analysis reveals that Li4C8H2O6 can be reversibly cycled at both potential windows of 1.8–3.2 V and 0.4–2.0 V, corresponding to the redox reactions of Li4C8H2O6/Li2C8H2O6 and Li4C8H2O6/Li6C8H2O6, respectively. Among the examined morphologies, nanosheets show the best electrochemical performance with the first discharge capacity of 223 mAh g–1 at 0.1 C (about 93% of the theoretical capacity 241 mAh g–1), the discharge capacity of 145 mAh g–1 at 5 C, and a capacity retention of 95% after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. All-organic LIBs constructed with Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets as the initial active materials of both positive and negative electrodes display high performance with an average operation voltage of 1.8 V and an energy density of about 130 Wh kg–1. The results show that Li4C8H2O6 nanosheets with a high-specific surface area and multifunctional groups are promising in the applications of all organic LIBs.  
总而言之，我们已经系统地研究了2，5-二羟基对苯二甲酸的有机四锂盐（Li4C8H2O6）的电化学性能，具有本体，纳米颗粒和纳米片的形态。 Li4C8H2O6在EC /DEC电解质中的溶解度非常低。电化学研究，DFT建模，异位红外研究和原位拉曼分析的结合表明，Li4C8H2O6可以在1.8–3.2 V和0.4–2.0 V的两个潜在窗口中可逆循环，对应于Li4C8H2O6 /Li2C8H2O6的氧化还原反应和分别为Li4C8H2O6 /Li6C8H2O6。在检查的形态中，纳米片表现出最佳的电化学性能，其在0.1 C时的首次放电容量为223 mAh g–1（约为理论容量241 mAh g–1的93％），在145°C时的首次放电容量为145 mAh g–1 5 C，在0.1 C下经过50次循环后，容量保持率达到95％。以Li4C8H2O6纳米片作为正极和负极的初始活性材料构造的全有机LIB具有高性能，平均工作电压为1.8 V，能量为密度约为130 Wh kg-1。结果表明，具有高比表面积和多功能基团的Li4C8H2O6纳米片在所有有机LIB的应用中都很有希望。
