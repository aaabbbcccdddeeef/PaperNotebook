Rechargeable lithium batteries with organic electrode materials are promising energy storage systems with advantages of structural designability, low cost, renewability, and environmental friendliness. Among the reported organic electrode materials, small organic carbonyl compounds are powerful candidates with high theoretical capacities and fast kinetics. However, these compounds are plagued by high solubility in aprotic electrolytes, which is considered as the main issue leading to capacity decay and short cycling life. Herein we review two major methods to solve this problem, including the preparation of small organic carbonyl salts and optimization of the electrolyte. The polarities of organic electrode materials can be enhanced by forming salts. Thus, the dissolution of the organic compounds in aprotic electrolytes with low polarity is depressed. Meanwhile, optimization of the electrolyte with increasing viscosity can also reduce the dissolution. These two strategies provide guidance for future studies of rechargeable lithium batteries with organic electrode materials.  
具有有机电极材料的可再充电锂电池是有前途的储能系统，其具有结构设计性，低成本，可更新性和环境友好性的优点。在已报道的有机电极材料中，小的有机羰基化合物是具有高理论容量和快速动力学的强大候选物。然而，这些化合物由于在非质子电解质中的高溶解度而困扰，这被认为是导致容量衰减和短循环寿命的主要问题。本文中，我们综述了解决该问题的两种主要方法，包括制备小的有机羰基盐和优化电解质。通过形成盐可以增强有机电极材料的极性。因此，抑制了有机化合物在具有低极性的非质子电解质中的溶解。同时，通过增加粘度来优化电解质也可以减少溶解。这两种策略为将来使用有机电极材料的可再充电锂电池的研究提供了指导。

## 1 Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have achieved great success in portable electronics such as smart phones and laptops in the past two decades.(1-3) Large-scale application of LIBs has also been recently demonstrated in electric vehicles and smart grids.(4) However, further development of LIBs with inorganic transition metal oxides as the cathode materials faces the bottleneck of limited capacity and resources (Figure 1a).(5-8) A feasible solution for such troubles is the development of organic electrode materials with high capacity and wide abundance (Figure 1b).(9-11) Organic electrode materials, which mainly consist of C, H, O, N, and S, possess the advantages of low cost, structure designability, and green sustainability.(12-14) There are four major types of organic electrode materials: conductive polymers,(15) organosulfurs,(16) organic free radical compounds,(17) and organic carbonyl compounds.(9, 10) In particular, organic carbonyl compounds have been widely studied because of their high theoretical capacity and fast reaction kinetics.(10, 18) According to the molecular weight, organic carbonyl compounds can be divided into two major categories: small organic carbonyl compounds and organic carbonyl polymers.(19-22) Small organic carbonyl compounds have shown the merits of facile synthetic process, high capacity, and sufficient space for Li-ion insertion but suffer from low electronic conductivity and high solubility in aprotic electrolytes. This leads to serious capacity decay and short cycling life of the electrodes.  
在过去的二十年中，锂离子电池（LIB）在便携式电子产品如智能电话和笔记本电脑中取得了巨大的成功。（1-3）最近在电动汽车和智能电网中也证明了LIB的大规模应用。（ 4）然而，以无机过渡金属氧化物为正极材料的LIB的进一步开发面临容量和资源有限的瓶颈（图1a）。（5-8）解决此类问题的可行解决方案是开发高有机电极材料（9-1）主要由C，H，O，N和S组成的有机电极材料具有成本低，结构可设计性和绿色可持续性的优点。（12-14）有机电极材料有四种主要类型：导电聚合物，（15）有机硫，（16）有机自由基化合物，（17）和有机羰基化合物。（9，10）特别是有机羰基化合物已广泛使用因为他们高理论容量和快速反应动力学。（10，18）根据分子量，有机羰基化合物可分为两大类：小型有机羰基化合物和有机羰基聚合物。（19-22）小型有机羰基化合物已显示它具有合成工艺简便，容量大，可插入锂离子的优点，但其电导率低且在非质子电解质中的溶解度高。这导致严重的电容衰减和电极的短循环寿命。

To improve the conductivity of organic carbonyl compounds, carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes(23) (CNTs), graphene,(24) and porous carbon(25, 26) with high conductivity have been applied. With the methods of mixing in selected solvents,(24) thermal treatment,(26) impregnation,(25) and in situ grafting,(27) organic materials can be loaded on highly conductive carbon materials in situ to form organic carbonyl compound/carbon composites. In addition, the organic materials can be immobilized on specific substrates through π–π stacking interactions(23) or covalent interactions,(27) which can simultaneously decrease the dissolution in the aprotic electrolyte. Further research on carbon composites should focus on optimizing the ratios of organic active materials in the composites to achieve high electrochemical performance with high energy/power density, high stability, and long cycling life.(28)  
为了提高有机羰基化合物的电导率，已使用了具有高电导率的碳材料，例如碳纳米管（23）（CNT），石墨烯（24）和多孔碳（25、26）。通过在选定的溶剂中混合，（24）热处理，（26）浸渍，（25）和原位接枝的方法，可以将（27）有机材料原位负载在高导电性碳材料上以形成有机羰基化合物/碳复合材料。另外，有机材料可以通过π-π堆积相互作用（23）或共价相互作用（27）固定在特定的基质上，这可以同时减少在非质子电解质中的溶解。碳复合材料的进一步研究应集中在优化复合材料中有机活性材料的比例，以实现具有高能量/功率密度，高稳定性和长循环寿命的高电化学性能。（28）

The high solubility of small organic carbonyl compounds in aprotic electrolytes can be derived from their similar polarities because both organic carbonyl compounds and aprotic electrolytes show low polarity.(9, 10) Efforts have been made to solve this problem, mainly including the formation of small organic carbonyl salts and optimization of the electrolyte. On one hand, compared with pure carbonyl compounds, carbonyl salts with O––Li+···O– chelate bonds show increased polarity, thereby inhibiting the dissolution in aprotic electrolytes.(9, 10) On the other hand, optimization of the electrolyte, such as the preparation of high-concentration,(29) quasi-solid-state,(30) and all-solid-state(31) electrolytes, is also an efficient way to solve the dissolution problem. The increased viscosity and restrained solvent in the optimized electrolyte will certainly inhibit the dissolution. Herein we review the recent development of electrodes with small organic carbonyl salts and advanced electrolytes in LIBs. Moreover, strategies for the design of organic salt electrodes are described, such as tunability of the operation potential by introducing heteroatoms, enhancement of the theoretical capacity by adding more carbonyls, and increasing the conductivity by extending conjugated structures. Meanwhile, the challenges and prospects of advanced electrolytes are also discussed, including the solution toward the low conductivity of solid-state electrolytes and the universality of high-concentration electrolytes. As a result, this review should not only provide a basic acquaintance with small organic carbonyl salts and advanced electrolytes but also point out the directions toward further research and development of rechargeable batteries with organic electrode materials.  
小型有机羰基化合物在非质子传递电解质中的高溶解度可从它们的相似极性中获得，因为有机羰基化合物和非质子传递电解质都显示出低极性。（9，10）致力于解决此问题的努力，主要包括形成小的有机羰基盐和电解质的优化。一方面，与纯羰基化合物相比，具有O––Li +···O–螯合键的羰基盐显示出增加的极性，从而抑制了在非质子电解质中的溶解。（9，10）另一方面，优化了电解质诸如制备高浓度，（29）准固态，（30）和全固态（31）电解质等方法，也是解决溶解问题的有效方法。优化电解质中粘度的增加和溶剂的限制肯定会抑制溶解。本文中，我们回顾了LIB中带有小有机羰基盐和高级电解质的电极的最新发展。此外，描述了用于设计有机盐电极的策略，例如通过引入杂原子来调节工作电位，通过添加更多的羰基来增强理论容量，以及通过扩展共轭结构来提高电导率。同时，还讨论了先进电解质的挑战和前景，包括解决固态电解质低电导率的解决方案和高浓度电解质的普遍性。因此，本综述不仅应与小有机羰基盐和先进的电解质基本相识，而且还指出了进一步研究和开发具有有机电极材料的可充电电池的方向。

## 2 Results and Discussion
### 2.1 Electrodes of Small Organic Carbonyl Salts
To date, there are three broad categories of small organic carbonyl salts, namely, carboxylates, quinone (or oxocarbon) salts, and amide salts. Generally, carboxylates with decreased lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy are applied as anodes with one Li-ion insertion per −COOLi group (type 1; Scheme 1 and Figure 2).(32) In comparison, most quinone or oxocarbon salts with two –OLi groups are applied as cathode materials with the remaining −OLi group to inhibit dissolution (type 2; Scheme 1 and Figure 2).(11) The dilithium diimide salts are expected to undergo a tautomerization reaction with utilization of half of the carbonyls (type 3; Scheme 1 and Figure 2).(33) Compared with most inorganic electrode materials prepared at high temperature, organic carbonyl salts are usually prepared at room temperature or moderate temperature by means of proton-replacement or dehydration reactions.(32) Thus, the preparation of organic electrode materials has the advantages of lower energy consumption and shorter production time.  
迄今为止，存在三大类小有机羰基盐，即羧酸盐，醌（或碳氧化合物）盐和酰胺盐。通常，具有最低最低未占据分子轨道（LUMO）能量的羧酸盐​​被用作阳极（负极），每个-COOLi基团插入一个锂离子（类型1；方案1和图2）。（32）相比之下，大多数醌或含氧碳酸盐具有将两个–OLi基团用作阴极（正极）材料，其余的–OLi基团用于抑制溶解（类型2；方案1和图2）。（11）预计二酰亚胺二锂盐会发生互变异构反应，并且利用一半的羰基（类型3;方案1和图2）。（33）与大多数高温下制备的无机电极材料相比，有机羰基盐通常在室温或中温下通过质子置换或脱水反应制备。（32）因此，制备有机电极材料具有能耗低，生产时间短的优点。

#### 2.1.1 Carboxylates
Two kinds of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylates have been reported as anodes in LIBs. All of the aliphatic carboxylates with reversibility are trans versions (compounds 1–3; Figure 3).(32, 34) Increasing the conjugation number decreases the capacity because of the enhanced molecular weight and lowers the polarization as a result of the increased electron delocalization. Meanwhile, the aliphatic carboxylates can actually uptake about one Li ion per formula unit, which is caused by the rapid increase in energy for inserting the second Li according to results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a comparison, the aromatic carboxylates with π-conjugated structures are able to uptake two Li ions per formula unit. For instance, Li2C8H4O4 (Li2TP, compound 4) can undergo insertion of two Li ions with a reversible capacity of 300 mA h g–1 and a capacity retention of 78% after 50 cycles. Moreover, Li2TP has two advantages compared with traditional graphene anodes: better thermal stability and a faster Li-ion diffusion process.(35) The DFT results reveal that the Li-ion diffusion barrier of Li2–Li2TP is 270 meV lower than that of LiC6. In addition to Li2TP, CaTP, and Al2/3TP (compounds 5 and 6) can also be obtained by a displacement reaction.(36) Among the three TP salts, CaTP displays the best capacity retention. The lowest dissolution in the electrolyte (1.8 ppm) and the maintained crystal/morphological structure contribute to this result. The simple conjugated carboxylates usually exhibit low conductivity. With in situ carbon coating and smaller particle size, the high-rate performance can be rationally enhanced (compound 7).(37-39)  
已经报道了两种脂族和芳族羧酸盐作为LIB中的阳极。**所有具有可逆性的脂族羧酸盐都是反式（化合物1-3；图3）。** （32，34）**由于增加的分子量，增加共轭数会降低容量，并由于电子离域增加而导致极化降低。** 同时，**根据密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的结果，脂肪族羧酸盐实际上可以每个配方单位吸收约一个Li离子，这是由于插入第二个Li的能量迅速增加引起的。** 作为比较，**具有π共轭结构的芳族羧酸盐能够在每个配方单元中吸收两个Li离子。** 例如，Li2C8H4O4（Li2TP，化合物4）可以插入两个Li离子，其可逆容量为300 mA h g-1，在50个循环后的容量保持率为78％。此外，与传统的石墨烯阳极相比，Li2TP具有两个优点：更好的热稳定性和更快的锂离子扩散过程。（35）**DFT结果表明，Li2-Li2TP的锂离子扩散势垒比LiC6低270 meV。**  除了Li2TP之外，CaTP和Al2 /3TP（化合物5和6）还可以通过置换反应获得。（36）在三种TP盐中，CaTP表现出最佳的容量保持率。电解质中最低的溶解度（1.8 ppm）和保持的晶体/形态结构有助于该结果。**简单的共轭羧酸盐通常显示出低电导率。通过原位碳涂层和较小的粒径，可以合理地提高高倍率性能（化合物7）。（37-39）**

Through the introduction of heteroatoms and extension of the conjugated structure, the working potential of carboxylates can be rationally tuned. A heterocyclic carboxylate (Li2TDC, compound 8; Figure 4) displays a discharge potential of 1.0 V (first cycle), which is about 0.2 V higher than that of Li2TP.(40) Meanwhile, N-heterocyclic compounds (compounds 9 and 10) also show higher discharge potentials.(41) Although the enhanced potential lowers the total energy density coupled with the cathode, the high potential can effectively inhibit the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and thus increase the initial Coulombic efficiency.(41) In addition, the relatively high discharge cutoff potential makes a cheap Al current collector appropriate for this type of anode. Interestingly, some carboxylate compounds (Li2TP and Li2TDC) show an excess discharge capacity at low discharge voltage.(40) This shows that the double bond in the heterocyclic and aromatic core can also reversibly undergo insertion of excess Li ions, which has been well-characterized by high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy using 13C-isotope-labeled Li2TP and Li2TDC.  
通过引入杂原子和扩展共轭结构，可以合理地调节羧酸盐的工作电位。杂环羧酸盐（Li2TDC，化合物8;图4）的放电电位为1.0 V（第一个循环），比Li2TP的放电电位高约0.2 V.（40）同时，N杂环化合物（化合物9和10）也表现出更高的放电电位。（41）**尽管增强的电位降低了与阴极耦合的总能量密度，但高电位可以有效地抑制固体电解质中间相（SEI）膜的形成，从而提高初始库仑效率。**（41）另外，较高的放电截止电位使得便宜的Al集电器适合于这种类型的阳极。有趣的是，**一些羧酸盐化合物（Li2TP和Li2TDC）在低放电电压下显示出过量的放电容量。（40）这表明杂环和芳香核中的双键也可以可逆地插入过量的锂离子，这很好通过13 C同位素标记的Li2TP和Li2TDC进行高分辨率固态NMR光谱分析。**

To improve the high-rate stability of organic salts at the molecule-design level, a few compounds with extended π-conjugated structures have been designed (group 4).(42-47) Simultaneously, the extended conjugation is beneficial for lowering the polarization between discharge and charge (compound 12).(42) Among them, dilithium 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (Li2NDC, compound 11) has been comprehensively investigated.(43-45) In addition to the better high-rate performance, Li2NDC has also been demonstrated as a favorable anode for safe LIBs because its framework structure is maintained with a very small volume change after intercalation of about two Li ions.(44) Moreover, further study has shown that the capacity of Li2NDC can be improved by narrowing the distance between naphthalene layers with an annealing process, which is helpful for the formation of efficient ion and electron pathways of the framework.(45) As an application example, full cells with Li2NDC as the anode and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as the cathode display excellent cycling performance, including a capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles, a high operation voltage near 4 V, and specific and power densities of 300 W h kg–1 and 5 kW/kg, respectively. As a general comparison with commercial anode materials such as graphite in LIBs, the carboxylates usually display a higher operation voltage with a bit lower theoretical capacity. The main advantage of carboxylate anodes is considered to be their high safety. For instance, some reported organic anodes such as Li2C6H4O4 and Li2C8H4O4 have been proved to exhibit more stable electrochemical reactivity than graphite at 80 °C.(32) Meanwhile, DFT calculations have demonstrated smaller Li-diffusion barriers in some organic electrodes in comparison with that of graphite. Finally, the relatively high operation voltage enhances the energy utilization efficiency in the first cycle as a result of the suppressive formation of a SEI film.  
为了在分子设计水平上提高有机盐的高稳定性，设计了一些具有扩展π共轭结构的化合物（第4组）。（42-47）**同时，扩展共轭有利于降低极化在放电和充电之间（化合物12）。**（42）其中，对2,6-萘二甲酸二锂盐（Li2NDC，化合物11）进行了全面研究。（43-45）除了更好的高倍率性能外，Li2NDC还具有已被证明是安全的LIB的理想阳极，因为在插入约两个Li离子后其骨架结构保持很小的体积变化。（44）此外，进一步的研究表明，**可以通过缩小距离来提高Li2NDC的容量在萘层之间进行退火处理，这有助于形成骨架的有效离子和电子路径。**（45）作为应用示例，以Li2NDC为阳极和LiNi0.5Mn1的全电池为例。 5O4作为阴极显示出出色的循环性能，包括100次循环后96％的容量保持率，4 V附近的高工作电压以及300 W h kg-1和5 kW /kg的比密度和功率密度。**作为与商业阳极材料（如LIB中的石墨）的一般比较，羧酸盐通常显示出较高的工作电压，而理论容量却稍低。羧酸盐阳极的主要优点被认为是其高安全性。** 例如，已证明某些报道的有机阳极，例如Li2C6H4O4和Li2C8H4O4在80°C时表现出比石墨更稳定的电化学反应性。（32）**同时，DFT计算表明，与石墨相比，某些有机电极中的Li扩散势垒更小。最后，由于抑制了SEI膜的形成，较高的工作电压提高了第一循环中的能量利用效率。**

Organic electrode materials have the advantage of structure designability. Rationally managing the active functional groups on carboxylates allows tuning of the reactions of the electrodes. For instance, adding a carboxylate group on the body of a quinone can not only reduce the dissolution but also enhance the theoretical capacity. Yoshida’s group introduced two lithiooxycarbonyl groups into the molecules 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ), 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ), and pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PYT) and prepared three organic carboxylate electrodes (compounds 14–16; Figure 5).(48) The capacity retention of these carboxylates was 80–100% after 20 cycles, while that of the normal quinone was only 20–40% after the same number of cycles. Connecting the −OLi group on the benzene ring of Li2TP would afford an organic electrode with a dual function. The obtained Li4C8H2O6 (compound 17) can also be applied as both an anode material and a cathode material (Figure 5).(49, 50) Meanwhile, Li4C8H2O6 has been initially reported to be obtained using a low-polluting and original synthesis scheme, allowing it to be used as a green electrode in rechargeable lithium batteries.(49) On the anode side, the reversible reaction of Li4C8H2O6/Li6C8H2O6 takes place at a voltage of 0.8 V. On the cathode side, the reversible reaction of Li4C8H2O6/Li2C8H2O6 is observed at a voltage of 2.6 V. Morphologies of nanosheets, nanoparticles, and bulk Li4C8H2O6 were prepared. In particular, the Li4C8H2O6 nanosheet electrode exhibited best capacity retention (95%) after 50 cycles at a charge/discharge rate of 0.1 C. More importantly, the as-prepared Li4C8H2O6 can be assembled as symmetrical cells with Li4C8H2O6 as both the cathode and the anode. As expected, the open-circuit voltage of this symmetrical cell is ∼0 V. However, after charging, this organic battery displays a discharge voltage of 1.8 V and an energy density of nearly 130 W h kg–1.(50) In addition, as a structural isomer, another Li4C8H2O6 compound with two hydroxyl–Li at the ortho positions (compound 18) has also been studied.(51) Compared with the prior structure of two hydroxyl–Li at the para positions, this Li4C8H2O6 molecule exhibits a higher operation voltage of 2.85 V as a cathode material, which is supposed to be the result of the lower LUMO energy of o-Li4C8H2O6 compared with p-Li4C8H2O6.  
有机电极材料具有结构设计性的优点。合理地管理羧酸盐上的活性官能团可以调节电极的反应。例如，在醌体上添加羧酸根基团不仅可以减少溶解，而且可以提高理论容量。吉田的研究小组将两个硫代氧羰基引入分子9,10-蒽醌（AQ），9,10-菲醌（PQ）和-4 4,5,9,10-四酮（PYT）中，并制备了三个有机羧酸盐电极（化合物14-16；图5）。（48）在20个循环后，这些羧酸盐的容量保留率为80-100％，而在相同数目的循环后，普通醌的容量保留率仅为20-40％。**在Li2TP的苯环上连接-OLi基团将提供具有双重功能的有机电极。** 所得的Li4C8H2O6（化合物17）也可用作阳极材料和阴极材料（图5）。（49，50）同时，据报道，Li4C8H2O6最初是使用低污染的原始合成方案获得的，使其可用作可再充电锂电池的绿色电极。（49）在阳极侧，Li4C8H2O6 /Li6C8H2O6可逆反应在0.8 V的电压下发生。在阴极侧，Li4C8H2O6 /Li2C8H2O6可逆反应在2.6V的电压下观察到该电导率。制备了纳米片，纳米颗粒和块状Li 4 C 8 H 2 O 6的形态。特别地，Li4C8H2O6纳米片电极在0.1 C的充电/放电速率下经过50次循环后表现出最佳的容量保持率（95％）。更重要的是，所制备的Li4C8H2O6可以组装成对称的电池，同时Li4C8H2O6既是阴极又是阴极。阳极。正如预期的那样，该对称电池的开路电压约为0V。但是，充电后，该有机电池的放电电压为1.8 V，能量密度接近130 W h kg-1。（50）作为结构异构体，还研究了另一种在邻位具有两个羟基-Li的Li4C8H2O6化合物（化合物18）。（51）与在对位具有两个羟基-Li的现有结构相比，该Li4C8H2O6分子具有作为阴极材料，其工作电压较高，为2.85 V，这是由于o-Li4C8H2O6与p-Li4C8H2O6相比具有较低的LUMO能量。

#### 2.1.2 Quinone and Oxocarbon Salts
Quinone electrode materials have been investigated for over 40 years. The high solubility is regarded as the major issue for capacity fading. The fabrication of oxocarbon and quinone electrodes with salt substituents has proved to be a way to solve this problem.(52) An electrode consisting of the oxocarbon salt Li2C6O6 (compound 19; Figure 6) with a proposed insertion of four Li ions and a high theoretical capacity of 589 mA h g–1 has been studied and displays a high initial discharge capacity of 580 mA h g–1.(11) However, this electrode undergoes fast decays for the multiple two-phase reactions. Particularly, the reaction of the initial two Li-ion insertion process from Li2C6O6 to Li4C6O6 results in a major morphological change that leads to exfoliation and isolation of the active material and then a decrease in the capacity.(53) The cyclability can be improved with a limited operation region between 1.5 and 2.5 V with the expected reaction of Li4C6O6/Li6C6O6 (compound 22). Another oxocarbon salt, Na2C5O5, has encountered similar problem, while the prepared nanowire-structured Na2C5O5 (compound 20) exhibits improved cycle life due to released structural stress. This demonstrates the significance of preparing nanostructured organic electrodes.(54) With inspiration from the multistep reactions of Li2C6O6, an all-organic LIB has also been constructed with Li6C6O6 as the anode and Li2C6O6 as the cathode.(55) This “greener and sustainable” all-organic LIB exhibits a working voltage of about 1.0 V with a reversible capacity of 200 mA h g–1. Another derivative of Li2DHDMQ (compound 23) can reversibly deintercalate about one Li at an average potential of 3 V, and the γ-Al2O3 additive has been proved beneficial to absorb the dissolved active materials.(56) As with the carboxylates, a more extended π-conjugated structure is helpful for increasing the conductivity and maintaining long cycle stability (compound 24).(57) In addition to the lithiated enolate functional group, the −SO3Na group can also solve the dissolution problem of the quinone (compounds 25 and 26).(58) Moreover, −SO3Na is an electron-withdrawing group, which is able to decrease the LUMO energy of the organic compound, resulting in an enhanced working potential.  
醌电极材料已经研究了40多年。高溶解度被认为是容量衰减的主要问题。事实证明，制造具有盐取代基的碳氧化合物和醌电极是解决此问题的一种方法。（52）一种由碳氧化合物盐Li2C6O6（化合物19；图6）组成的电极，建议插入四个Li离子并形成高浓度已经研究了589 mA hg-1的理论容量，并显示了580 mA hg-1的高初始放电容量。（11）但是，该电极经历了多个两相反应的快速衰减。特别是，最初的两个从Li2C6O6到Li4C6O6的锂离子插入过程的反应导致主要的形态变化，导致活性物质的剥落和分离，然后容量降低。（53） Li4C6O6 /Li6C6O6（化合物22）的预期反应在1.5至2.5 V之间的有限工作区域内进行。另一种碳氧化合物盐Na2C5O5遇到了类似的问题，而制得的纳米线结构Na2C5O5（化合物20）由于释放了结构应力而具有改善的循环寿命。这证明了制备纳米结构有机电极的重要性。（54）在Li2C6O6的多步反应的启发下，还构建了以Li6C6O6为阳极，Li2C6O6为阴极的全有机LIB。（55）“更绿色，可持续发展”全有机LIB的工作电压约为1.0 V，可逆容量为200 mA hg-1。 Li2DHDMQ的另一种衍生物（化合物23）可以在3 V的平均电势下可逆地脱嵌约一个Li，并且已证明γ-Al2O3添加剂有利于吸收溶解的活性物质。（56）与羧酸盐一样，它的延伸更广。 π共轭结构有助于提高电导率并保持长周期稳定性（化合物24）。（57）除锂化的烯醇酸酯官能团外，-SO3Na基团还可以解决醌的溶解问题（化合物25和26 ）。（58）此外，-SO 3 Na是吸电子基团，其能够降低有机化合物的LUMO能，从而提高了工作电位。

#### 2.1.3 Aromatic Amide and Other Salts
The substitution of H by Li in diimide compounds to afford dilithium diimide salts (compounds 27 and 28; Figure 7) can also effectively resolve the solubility issues.(33, 59) For instance, in a comparison of the electrochemical properties of three N-containing naphthalenediimides (NDs), NDLi (compound 28), NDH (H occupies a Li site), and NDMe (methyl occupies a Li site) showed 87.6%, 45%, and ignorable capacity retention after 100 cycles, respectively. The aromatization of NDLi with the lithiated state contributes to the superior performance. Other carbonyl salts such as the commercial blue dye indigo carmine with the inherent sodium sulfonate (−SO3Na) group (compound 29)(60) and an organic ester salt with a lithiated enolate (−OLi) group(61) have also been applied as cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries.  
在二酰亚胺化合物中用Li取代H以得到二酰亚胺二锂盐（化合物27和28;图7）也可以有效解决溶解度问题。（33，59）例如，比较三种N-的电化学性质含有萘二甲酰亚胺（NDs），NDLi（化合物28），NDH（H占据Li位点）和NDMe（甲基占据Li位点）的化合物在100个循环后分别显示出87.6％，45％和可忽略的容量保持率。锂化状态的NDLi的芳构化有助于提高性能。其他羰基盐，例如带有固有磺酸钠（-SO3Na）（化合物29）（60）的商业蓝色染料靛蓝胭脂红和带有锂化烯酸酯（-OLi）组的有机酯盐（61）也已被用作可充电锂电池的阴极。

Here we review only the small organic salts for rechargeable lithium batteries (the detailed electrochemical properties are listed in Table S1). Recently, a few salts (Na2C6H4O4,(62, 63) Na2C6O6,(64) Na2C8H2O6,(65) Na2C5O5,(66) and MgC6H4O4·xH2O (x = 0, 2)(67)) have been prepared for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries, and the summed strategies are also feasible for these salts. The future development of electrodes with small organic salts should depend on the following aspects: (1) When the operation voltage and capacity are taken into account, the anode design with organic carbonyl salts should focus on aromatic compounds with multiple −COOLi groups. This is the case because aromatic compounds usually exhibit lower operation voltage, while multiple −COOLi groups provide more electrons with a high theoretical capacity. (2) As cathode materials, increasing the operation voltage with reserved high capacity still remains a challenge. Our group proved that using a molecule design strategy with the introduction of heteroatoms can reduce the LUMO energy, leading to an increase in the reduction potential.(24) Meanwhile, connecting the benzene ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as −CN, −F, and −Cl is also available to enhance the operation voltage.(68, 69) (3) Insights into the changes in the crystal structure during the Li-ion intercalation and deintercalation reaction processes are still limited for electrodes with small organic salts, which also provides a broad development space for further study.  
在这里，我们仅审查可再充电锂电池的小型有机盐（**详细的电化学性能列在表S1中**）。最近，已经准备了一些盐（Na2C6H4O4，（62，63）Na2C6O6，（64）Na2C8H2O6，（65）Na2C5O5，（66）和MgC6H4O4·xH2O（x = 0，2）（67））-离子电池，总结这些盐的策略也是可行的。带有小有机盐的电极的未来发展应取决于以下方面：（1）考虑到工作电压和容量，带有有机羰基盐的阳极设计应着重于具有多个-COOLi基团的芳族化合物。之所以如此，是因为芳族化合物通常表现出较低的工作电压，而多个-COOLi基团可提供更多具有较高理论容量的电子。 （2）作为阴极材料，在保留高容量的同时提高工作电压仍然是一个挑战。我们的研究小组证明，采用分子设计策略并引入杂原子可以降低LUMO能量，从而导致还原电位增加。（24）同时，将苯环与强吸电子基团（如-CN，-F和-Cl也可用于提高工作电压。（68，69）（3）对于含少量有机盐的电极，在锂离子嵌入和脱嵌反应过程中对晶体结构变化的见解仍然有限，这也为进一步的研究提供了广阔的发展空间。

### 2.2 Advanced Electrolytes
Small organic carbonyl electrodes suffer from high solubility in traditional electrolytes. In addition to the preparation of organic carbonyl salts, the optimization of electrolytes such as all-solid-state, quasi-solid-state, and high-concentration electrolytes is another efficient way to solve this problem. A typical solid-state electrolyte usually contains a polymer host such as poly(ethylene oxide)) (PEO) or poly(methacrylate) (PMA)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and a Li salt such as LiClO4 or LiTFSA (Figure 8a).(31, 70-74) Meanwhile, there have also been studies of solid-state electrolytes based on conductive ionic liquid (IL) composites such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (Li-TFSA) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (EMI-TFSA)).(30, 75, 76) Especially, LiTFSA shows high solubility in ether-based electrolytes, which makes it possible to fabricate high-concentration electrolytes. The high-concentration electrolyte can trap the motion of the solvent, thus inhibiting the dissolution of the organic electrodes.(77, 78) In general, the ionic conductivities of different electrolytes at room temperature are in the order of all-solid-state electrolyte < quasi-solid-state electrolyte < high-concentration liquid electrolyte (Figure 8b).  
小型有机羰基电极在传统电解质中的溶解度很高。除了制备有机羰基盐以外，优化电解质（例如全固态，准固态和高浓度电解质）是解决此问题的另一种有效方法。典型的固态电解质通常包含聚合物主体，例如聚（环氧乙烷）（PEO）或聚（甲基丙烯酸酯）（PMA）/聚（乙二醇）（PEG）和锂盐（例如LiClO4或LiTFSA）（图8a）。（31，70-74）同时，还研究了基于导电离子液体（IL）复合材料的固态电解质，例如双（三氟甲磺酰基）酰胺锂（Li-TFSA）和1-乙基-3 -（甲基-三氟甲基磺酰基）酰胺-咪唑鎓盐（EMI-TFSA）。（30、75、76）特别地，LiTFSA在醚基电解质中显示出高溶解度，这使得可以制造高浓度电解质。高浓度电解质可以捕获溶剂的运动，从而抑制有机电极的溶解。（77，78）通常，不同电解质在室温下的离子电导率约为全固态电解质的量级<准固态电解质<高浓度液体电解质（图8b）。

#### 2.2.1 All-Solid-State Electrolyte
The all-solid-state electrolyte is endowed with the advantage of high safety. An all-solid-state lithium battery was fabricated using organic pillar[5]quinone (compound 31; Figure 9) as the cathode and a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE).(31) The selected PMA/PEG–LiClO4–3 wt % SiO2 CPE exhibited a highest ionic conductivity of 0.26 mS cm–1 at room temperature. The addition of SiO2 is an effective method to improve the ionic conductivity of solid-state electrolyte.(79) With the selected CPE, an initial capacity of 418 mA h g–1 and 94.7% capacity retention after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C was obtained. As a comparison, the electrode performance of P5Q tested in traditional liquid electrolytes with 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 (v/v) ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate solutions retains a capacity of only ∼230 mA h g–1 after 3 cycles, which can be ascribed to the serious dissolution of the active materials into the liquid electrolyte. Afterward, tetramethoxy-p-benzoquinone (compound 32) with a commercial all-solid-state PEO/LiTFSI-based electrolyte tested at 100 °C also displayed better cycling stability than the liquid electrolyte.(74) The increased operation temperature contributes to high conductivity (0.1 S cm–1) of the electrolyte and further improves the high-rate performance. At a high discharge rate of 1 Li+ per 12 min, 70% of the theoretical capacity can still be retained.  
全固态电解质具有高安全性的优点。使用有机支柱[5]醌（化合物31；图9）作为阴极和复合聚合物电解质（CPE）制成全固态锂电池。（31）选择的PMA /PEG–LiClO4–3 wt％室温下，SiO2 CPE的最高离子电导率为0.26 mS cm-1。 SiO2的添加是一种提高固态电解质离子电导率的有效方法。（79）使用所选的CPE，初始容量为418 mA hg–1，在以0.2 C的速率循环50次后，容量保持率为94.7％。获得了。相比之下，在传统的液态电解质中，使用1 M LiPF6在1：1（v /v）碳酸亚乙酯/碳酸二乙酯溶液中测试的P5Q的电极性能在3个循环后仅保持约230 mA hg-1的容量，这可以归因于活性物质严重溶解在液体电解质中。之后，四甲氧基对苯醌（化合物32）与在100°C下测试的市售全固态PEO /LiTFSI基电解质也显示出比液体电解质更好的循环稳定性。（74）升高的工作温度有助于获得较高的温度电解质的电导率（0.1 S cm-1），并进一步提高了高倍率性能。在每12分钟1 Li +的高放电速率下，仍可保留理论容量的70％。

#### 2.2.2 Quasi-Solid-State Electrolytes
Quasi-solid-state electrolytes are also an alternative candidate for organic batteries. Our group has developed a PMA/PEG-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for use as an electrolyte with satisfactory ionic conductivity for dye-sensitized solar cells.(80) Since this electrolyte shows the ability to entrap large numbers of liquid electrolyte molecules the PMA/PEG-based GPE has been further adopted to inhibit the dissolution of calix[4]quinone (C4Q) cathode material (compound 33). In addition to traditional quasi-solid-state electrolytes, IL-based quasi-solid-state electrolytes have also been proved feasible for trapping the dissolution.(30, 75, 76) Particularly, a silica–room-temperature IL composite quasi-solid-state electrolyte has been applied to assemble a solid-state cell with small organic carbonyl compounds that shows high theoretical capacities (compounds 34–36).(30) Electrochemical tests manifested that the liquid cell exhibited serious fading with limited capacity retention (<100 mA h g–1) after five cycles, while negligible capacity loss could be detected with the same electrodes in the quasi-solid-state electrolyte after 10 cycles.  
准固态电解质也是有机电池的替代选择。我们小组开发了一种PMA /PEG基凝胶聚合物电解质（GPE），用作染料敏化太阳能电池具有令人满意的离子电导率的电解质。（80）由于该电解质具有捕获大量液体电解质分子的能力，因此基于PMA /PEG的GPE已被进一步用来抑制杯[4]醌（C4Q）阴极材料（化合物33）的溶解。除了传统的准固态电解质外，还证明了基于IL的准固态电解质可用于捕获溶解物。（30，75，76）特别是二氧化硅-室温的IL复合准固态态电解质已被用于组装具有小的具有理论容量的有机羰基化合物的固态电池（化合物34–36）。（30）电化学测试表明，液态电池表现出严重的褪色，容量保持率有限（<100在5个循环后达到mA hg-1），而在10个循环后使用准固态电解质中的相同电极可以检测到微不足道的容量损失。

#### 2.2.3 High-Concentration Electrolytes
Although the solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes can effectively inhibit the dissolution of organic electrode materials, the room-temperature conductivity of the electrolyte is about 10–3 S cm –1, which is still poor. Recently, nonconventional ether-based electrolytes have been proposed as a feasible solution to inhibit the dissolution.(81) The electrochemical performance of an AQ (compound 37)/CMK-3 nanocomposite in rechargeable lithium batteries was greatly promoted with an ether-based electrolyte (2 M LiN(CF3SO2)2 in 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane solvent with 1% LiNO3 additive).(29) This strategy is also applicable to other organic carbonyl compounds with quinone substructures. The performance was also enhanced with high stable capacities because ether-based electrolytes at high concentration can effectively decrease the solubility of carbonyl compounds. Meanwhile, a similar concept with a series of high-concentration ether-based electrolytes has also been adopted for sodium-ion batteries.(82) In selected 4 M ether-based electrolyte (CF3SO3Na as a sodium salt in triethylene glycol/dimethyl ether solvent), the AQ/CMK-3 nanocomposite exhibits an initial capacity of 190 mA h g–1 and a capacity retention of 88% after 50 cycles at 0.2 C. These results shed light on the development of ether-based electrolytes with high concentration.  
尽管固态和准固态电解质可以有效地抑制有机电极材料的溶解，但电解质的室温电导率约为10-3 S cm-1，这仍然很差。近年来，提出了一种非常规的基于醚的电解质作为抑制溶解的可行方案。（81）基于醚的电解质极大地促进了可充电锂电池中AQ（化合物37）/CMK-3纳米复合材料的电化学性能（在1,3二氧戊环/二甲氧基乙烷溶剂中，添加2％LiN（CF3SO2）2，添加1％LiNO3）。（29）此策略也适用于其他具有醌亚结构的有机羰基化合物。由于高浓度的基于醚的电解质可有效降低羰基化合物的溶解度，因此还具有高稳定容量，从而提高了性能。同时，钠离子电池也采用了一系列类似的概念，即一系列高浓度的基于醚的电解质。（82）在选定的4 M基于醚的电解质（CF3SO3Na在三甘醇/二甲醚溶剂中的钠盐形式）中），AQ /CMK-3纳米复合材料的初始容量为190 mA hg-1，在0.2 C下经过50次循环后的容量保持率为88％。这些结果为开发高浓度的基于醚的电解质提供了启示。

As summarized in Figure 10 and Table S2, the capacity retention can be dramatically enhanced with advanced electrolytes. Compared with commercial inorganic cathodes of LiMn2O4,(83) LiFePO4,(84) and LiCoO2,(85) these organic electrodes with an advanced electrolyte usually exhibit high capacity, although the low operation voltage and the necessity of a metal Li anode are key issues to be resolved. Meanwhile, it must be mentioned that because of the low conductivity, more conductive additives should be added for organic electrodes. These additives would decrease the total energy density of organic cathodes. Thus, developing high-conductivity organic electrodes with the addition of low-content conductivities is strongly demanded in practical applications. At the present time, the design of advanced electrolytes for organic electrodes is still at the beginning. For all-solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, the ionic conductivity is still low. Recently, some inorganic solid-state electrolytes such as Li10GeP2S12(86) and Li10SnP2S12(87) have shown ionic conductivities comparable to those of organic liquid electrolytes and have potential for the application of organic electrode materials. For high-concentration ether-based electrolytes, the universal feasibility with other organic electrodes still needs to be assessed. In addition, other novel liquid electrolytes such as IL electrolytes might also be a proper selection.(88)  
如图10和表S2所示，使用先进的电解液可以显着提高容量保持率。与商业化的LiMn2O4，（83）LiFePO4，（84）和LiCoO2，（85）无机阴极相比，这些具有高级电解质的有机电极通常显示出高容量，尽管低工作电压和金属Li阳极的必要性是关键问题有待解决。同时，必须提到的是，由于低电导率，应为有机电极添加更多的导电添加剂。这些添加剂将降低有机阴极的总能量密度。因此，在实际应用中强烈要求开发具有低含量电导率的高电导率有机电极。目前，用于有机电极的高级电解质的设计仍处于起步阶段。对于全固态和准固态电解质，离子电导率仍然很低。近来，一些无机固态电解质，例如Li10GeP2S12（86）和Li10SnP2S12（87），已经显示出与有机液体电解质相当的离子电导率，并且具有应用有机电极材料的潜力。对于高浓度基于醚的电解质，仍需要评估其与其他有机电极的普遍可行性。此外，其他新型液体电解质，例如IL电解质也可能是合适的选择。（88）

## 3 Conclusions and Outlook
For small organic carbonyl salt electrodes, the relationship between the structure of the organic salt and the electrochemical properties can be rationally summarized as follows: (1) The carboxylates are usually applied as anodes of LIBs. The operation potential, conductivity, and theoretical capacity can be rationally tuned with proper design of the compound structure. For instance, aliphatic carboxylates usually exhibit utilization of half of the carbonyls because of the sharp increase in the energy barrier for the second Li-ion insertion (group 1). Among TP salts, CaTP shows the best cycling performance because it exhibits the lowest dissolution in the electrolyte (group 2). Introducing selected heteroatoms and extending the conjugated structure can reduce the LUMO energy, thus enhancing the working potential (groups 3 and 4). Meanwhile, the extended conjugated structure with high electron delocalization contributes to the high-rate performance (group 4). Adding −COOLi to the quinone body with increased carbonyl ratios can increase the theoretical capacity (group 5), and adding two active −OLi groups on the carboxylates affords bifunctional organic electrodes (group 6). (2) The oxocarbon/quinone salts with lower LUMO energies usually exhibit higher operation voltages than carboxylates (groups 7–9). Building nanostructured organic electrodes is beneficial for releasing the structural stress and hence improving the cycling life of oxocarbon salts (group 7). In addition, the −SO3Na group is an electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the working potential and decrease the dissolution at the same time (group 9). (3) The dilithium diimide salts are expected to undergo tautomerization upon Li-ion insertion and therefore exhibit long cycle life (group 10).  
对于小的有机羰基盐电极，有机盐的结构与电化学性能之间的关系可以合理地总结如下：
- （1）羧酸盐通常用作LIB的阳极。通过适当设计复合结构，可以合理地调节工作电势，电导率和理论容量。
- 例如，脂族羧酸盐通常会利用一半的羰基化合物，因为第二次锂离子插入（第1组）的能垒急剧增加。
- 在TP盐中，CaTP表现出最佳的循环性能，因为它在电解质中的溶解度最低（第2组）。
- 引入选定的杂原子并扩展共轭结构可以降低LUMO能量，从而提高工作潜力（第3和第4组）。
- 同时，具有高电子离域性的扩展共轭结构有助于实现高倍率性能（第4组）。
- 以增加的羰基比率将-COOLi添加至醌体可提高理论容量（第5组）
- 在羧酸盐上添加两个活性-OLi基团可提供双功能有机电极（第6组）。   
- （2）具有较低LUMO能量的碳氧化合物/醌盐通常显示出比羧酸盐更高的工作电压（7-9组）。
- 构建纳米结构的有机电极有利于释放结构应力，从而延长碳氧盐的循环寿命（第7组）。
- 此外，-SO3Na基团是一个吸电子基团，可以同时增加工作电位并降低溶解度（第9组）。 
- （3）预计二锂二酰亚胺盐在插入锂离子后会发生互变异构，因此显示出较长的循环寿命（第10组）。

For advanced electrolytes, the major conclusions are as follows: (1) the all-solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes can remarkably solve the dissolution problem. At a low current density, the capacity can approach the theoretical value. (2) Increasing the working temperature is conducive to the high-rate performance with the solid-state electrolyte because of the rapidly enhanced ionic conductivity. (3) High-concentration electrolytes can inhibit the dissolution of organic electrodes as a result of the increased viscosity and restrained motion of anions. Meanwhile, a relatively high ionic conductivity close to that of a normal electrolyte can still be maintained.  
对于高级电解质，主要结论如下：（1）全固态和准固态电解质可以显着解决溶解问题。在低电流密度下，容量可以接近理论值。 （2）由于迅速提高了离子电导率，因此提高工作温度有利于固态电解质的高倍率性能。 （3）高浓度电解质可抑制有机电极的溶解，这是由于粘度增加和阴离子运动受限所致。同时，仍可以保持接近于常规电解质的相对高的离子电导率。

This is still the beginning of the use of organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. Through preparation of small organic carbonyl salts and optimization of the electrolytes, the high solubility of organic electrodes in aprotic electrolytes can be inhibited well, which can lead to better electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries with organic electrodes. The solubility inhibition results from the increased polarities of small organic carbonyl salts compared with common organic materials and the enhanced viscosity when high-concentration or solid-state electrolytes are applied. However, such strategies must still be improved in further studies. For example, some prepared salts such as Li4C8H2O6 and Li2C6O6 are not stable in air because Li4C8H2O6 can be oxidized by oxygen and Li2C6O6 can easily adsorb water with the formation of Li2C6O6·2H2O. Therefore, more stable Li salts with high capacities are required in future research. For the solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, the low ionic conductivity must still be improved. Recent studies based on inorganic solid-state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity will be worth trying. Meanwhile, the future development of organic molecules should also rely on the following points: new compounds with high capacity and high potentials, polymerization of organic compounds with decreased dissolution, and micro-nanostructured electrodes with high-rate performance. Finally, the tapping density of organic molecules should also be considered.  
这仍然是有机电极材料用于可充电电池的开始。通过制备小的有机羰基盐和优化电解质，可以很好地抑制有机电极在非质子电解质中的高溶解度，从而可以改善带有有机电极的锂离子电池的电化学性能。与普通的有机材料相比，抑制作用的产生是由于较小的有机羰基盐的极性增加，以及使用高浓度或固态电解质时粘度增加。但是，此类策略仍需进一步研究加以改进。例如，某些制备的盐，例如Li4C8H2O6和Li2C6O6在空气中不稳定，因为Li4C8H2O6可以被氧气氧化，而Li2C6O6则容易吸附水，形成Li2C6O6·2H2O。因此，在未来的研究中需要更高容量的更稳定的锂盐。对于固态和准固态电解质，仍必须改善低离子电导率。基于具有高离子电导率的无机固态电解质的最新研究将值得尝试。同时，有机分子的未来发展还应依靠以下几点：具有高容量和高电势的新化合物，溶解度降低的有机化合物的聚合以及具有高倍率性能的微纳米结构电极。最后，还应考虑有机分子的振实密度。
