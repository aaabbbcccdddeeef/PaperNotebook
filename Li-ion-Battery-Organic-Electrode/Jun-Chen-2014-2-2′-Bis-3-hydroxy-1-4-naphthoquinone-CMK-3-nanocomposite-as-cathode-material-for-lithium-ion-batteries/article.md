## Abstract
An inorganic–organic nanocomposite with the filling of 2,2′-bis(3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) (H2bhnq) in the pores of CMK-3 mesoporous carbon, which was synthesized by a simple impregnation method, was employed as a new cathode material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The characterization of the nanocomposite by wide-angle and low-angle X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the efficient loading of H2bhnp within the nanosized pores of CMK-3 carbon. The nanocomposite delivered an initial discharge capacity of 308.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C rate and a capacity retention of 202.6 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles. The reversible capacities were 124.0 mAh g−1 at a higher rate of 10 C. The enhanced cycling stability and high-rate capability is attributed to the fact that neat H2bhnq was distributed in the nanochannels of the conductive carbon framework CMK-3. This constrains the dissolution of the embedded H2bhnq. The results imply that the nanoconfinement with the pores of inorganic materials such as CMK-3 to fill organic active materials is important to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries.  
采用简单浸渍法合成的在CMK-3介孔碳孔中填充2,2'-双（3-羟基-1,4-萘醌）（H2bhnq）的无机-有机纳米复合材料作为可充电锂离子电池（LIB）的新正极材料。通过广角和低角度X射线衍射，Brunauer-Emmett-Teller（BET），扫描电子显微镜（SEM）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）对纳米复合材料进行表征，表明H2bhnp在纳米孔中的有效负载CMK-3碳。纳米复合材料在0.1 C速率下的初始放电容量为308.6 mAh g-1，经过50个循环后的容量保持率为202.6 mAh g-1。在更高的10 C速率下，可逆容量为124.0 mAh g-1。增强的循环稳定性和高速率容量归因于纯H2bhnq分布在导电碳骨架CMK-3的纳米通道中的事实。这限制了嵌入的H2bhnq的溶解。结果表明，与无机材料（例如CMK-3）的孔纳米约束以填充有机活性材料对于提高锂离子电池的电化学性能非常重要。

## Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are representative electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices to power portable electronics. For applications in the emerging fields of electric vehicles (EV) and smart grids, there is an increasing requirement of improved safety, lower cost and higher energy density.1–3 Organic carbonyl compounds have attracted extensive attention as alternative active materials for LIBs due to their wide availability, environmentally-benign synthesis, high theoretical capacity and structural flexibility.4–8 Unfortunately, the liable dissolution of small organic molecules in aprotic electrolyte and the intrinsically poor electrical conductivity of organic compounds usually lead to rapid capacity fading and a lower rate capability, severely hindering their practical application.  
锂离子电池（LIB）是代表性的电化学能量存储和转换设备，可为便携式电子设备供电。对于在新兴的电动汽车（EV）和智能电网领域中的应用，对提高安全性，降低成本和提高能量密度的要求日益提高。1–3由于其原因，有机羰基化合物作为LIB的替代活性材料受到了广泛关注。它们的广泛应用，对环境无害的合成，较高的理论容量和结构灵活性。4–8不幸的是，小分子有机物在质子惰性电解质中的可靠溶解和有机化合物固有的导电性差，通常会导致容量快速衰减和速率降低能力，严重阻碍了它们的实际应用。

Several innovative strategies have been attempted to address the solubility problem of organic compounds in electrolytes, including increasing the molecular weight by polymerization,9–14 fabricating coordination compounds through Li–O or Li–N bond bridges15–18 and using a solid or quasi-solid-state electrolyte to replace the traditional liquid electrolyte.19,20 On the other hand, two common approaches have been used to enhance the electrical conductivity of organic electrodes. One is the incorporation of heteroaromatic structures in organic molecular frameworks21 while the other is resorting the active materials to conductive additives such as carbon nanostructures.22–25 Recently, a composite of 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) and mesoporous carbon has been proposed to simultaneously overcome the dissolution and poor conductivity issue of AQ,26 resulting in an improved cycle life and rate performance. Nevertheless, the relatively large open porous structure (with pore diameter of 50–60 nm) of the employed carbon cannot effectively prevent the dissolution of AQ in the electrolyte and thus only a limited capacity of 97 mAh g−1 has been maintained after 50 cycles for the composite electrode. An appropriate mesoporous carbon matrix with a smaller pore diameter for better confining organic material is desirable to attain an enhanced electrode performance.  
为了解决有机化合物在电解质中的溶解性问题，已经尝试了几种创新策略，包括通过聚合反应提高分子量，[9-14]通过Li–O或Li–N键桥15–18以及使用固体或准碳氢化合物制备配位化合物。固态电解质代替传统的液态电解质。19,20另一方面，已经采用了两种常见的方法来增强有机电极的电导率。一种是在有机分子框架中掺入杂芳族结构21，另一种是将活性材料求助于导电添加剂，例如碳纳米结构。22-25最近，有人提出将9,10-蒽醌（AQ）和中孔碳复合而成。同时克服了AQ [26]的溶解和不良电导率问题，从而提高了循环寿命和速率性能。然而，所用碳的相对较大的开放式多孔结构（孔径为50–60 nm）不能有效地防止AQ在电解质中的溶解，因此在50次循环后仅能维持97 mAh g-1的有限容量用于复合电极。为了获得增强的电极性能，期望具有较小孔径的合适的介孔碳基质以更好地限制有机材料。

Mesoporous CMK-3 carbon has been extensively investigated for potential applications such as catalyst support, hydrogen storage, supercapacitors and Li-S batteries,27–29 owning to its well-ordered porous structure, uniform small pore size (6–7 nm), large specific surface area and high conductivity.30 These properties of CMK-3 should make it a suitable matrix for loading soluble organic electrode materials. In this work, we apply CMK-3 to confine 2,2′-bis(3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) (H2bhnq). As a flexible hinge like ligand, H2bhnq has been widely used in coordination chemistry to construct metal–organic frameworks.31,32 However, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been reported for use in LIBs. Theoretically, H2bhnq could react with four Li per molecule, giving a high specific capacity of 309.6 mAh g−1 (Scheme 1a). Herein, we encapsulate H2bhnq in CMK-3 by a simple room-temperature impregnation method and demonstrate that the as-synthesized nanocomposite exhibits a respectable lithium-storage performance (Scheme 1b). It is found that the hurdles of poor conductivity and easy dissolution of H2bhnq in the aprotic electrolyte can be largely surmounted owing to the restriction of the nanoporous structure and the high electrical conductivity of the carbon framework.  
**介孔CMK-3碳已被广泛研究用于潜在的应用，例如催化剂载体，储氢，超级电容器和Li-S电池，[27-29]得益于其良好的多孔结构，均匀的小孔径（6-7 nm）比表面积大，导电率高**。30CMK-3的这些特性使其成为装载可溶性有机电极材料的合适基质。在这项工作中，我们将CMK-3应用于限制2,2'-双（3-羟基-1,4-萘醌）（H2bhnq）。作为一种像配体一样的柔性铰链，H2bhnq已广泛用于配位化学中以构建金属-有机骨架。31,32然而，据我们所知，尚未报道过可用于LIB中。从理论上讲，H2bhnq每分子可与四个Li反应，从而提供309.6 mAh g-1的高比容量（方案1a）。在这里，我们通过一种简单的室温浸渍方法将H2bhnq封装在CMK-3中，并证明合成后的纳米复合材料表现出可观的锂存储性能（方案1b）。发现由于纳米孔结构的限制和碳骨架的高电导率，可以大大克服电导率差和H2bhnq容易在非质子电解质中溶解的障碍。

## Experimental
### Synthesis
All reagents are of analytic grade unless stated. H2bhnq was synthesized by an oxidization method (Scheme S1, ESI†).33 In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol bi-1,4-naphthoquinone was dissolved in 5 mL 1,4-dioxane and 0.75 mL aqueous NaOH solution (5 mol L−1). Five drops of aqueous H2O2 (30%) were then added to the obtained suspension, forming a clear red solution. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 5 min and the insoluble reagent was filtered off. After the evaporation of the filtrate, the residue was recrystallized from glacial acetic acid to generate yellow amorphous powders (0.242 g, 70% yield).  
除非另有说明，否则所有试剂均为分析纯。 H2bhnq通过氧化方法合成（方案S1，ESI†）。33在典型的合成中，将1 mmol bi-1,4-萘醌溶于5 mL 1,4-二恶烷和0.75 mL NaOH水溶液（5 mol L -1）。然后将五滴H2O2水溶液（30％）添加到所获得的悬浮液中，形成澄清的红色溶液。将该混合物剧烈搅拌5分钟，并滤出不溶试剂。滤液蒸发后，将残余物从冰醋酸中重结晶，得到黄色无定形粉末（0.242g，70％产率）。

The H2bhnq/CMK-3 nanocomposite was prepared by a simple impregnation method. H2bhnq (50 mg) was first dissolved in 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 50 mg CMK-3 (purchased from Nanjing JiCang) was then added to the solution. The mixture was ultrasonically treated for 30 min. After that, the solvent was removed under vacuum to obtain the H2bhnq/CMK-3 nanocomposite. Samples with different compositions were also prepared by altering the mass ratio of H2bhnq and CMK-3.  
H2bhnq/CMK-3纳米复合材料是通过简单的浸渍方法制备的。首先将H2bhnq（50 mg）溶于1 mL二甲基亚砜（DMSO）中，然后将50 mg CMK-3（购自南京吉仓）添加到该溶液中。将混合物超声处理30分钟。之后，在真空下除去溶剂以获得H2bhnq/CMK-3纳米复合材料。还可以通过改变H2bhnq和CMK-3的质量比来制备具有不同组成的样品。

### Material characterization
The structures of H2bhnq were determined by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Varian Mercury Vx300 MHz spectrometer) and elemental analysis (German, VarioEL). The IR spectra were collected at room temperature using a FTIR-650 spectrometer (Tianjin Gangdong) between 4000 and 400 cm−1. The TG measurements were performed under an Ar atmosphere with a NETZSCH TG 209 using a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The obtained H2bhnq/CMK-3 composites were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction in the wide 2θ range of 10–80° (Rigaku MiniFlex600, CuKα radiation) and in the small 2θ range of 0.6–6° (Bruker D8FOCUS, CuKα radiation). The morphologies and microstructures of the materials were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM7500F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai-F20). The surface area and pore size distribution were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K on a BELSORP-mini instrument.  
H2bhnq的结构通过1H和13C核磁共振波谱（NMR，Varian Mercury Vx300 MHz光谱仪）和元素分析（German，VarioEL）确定。使用FTIR-650光谱仪（天津港东）在室温下收集4000至400 cm-1之间的红外光谱。 TG测量是在Ar气氛下使用NETZSCH TG 209在5°C min-1的加热速率下进行的。所获得的H2bhnq /CMK-3复合材料的特征在于，粉末X射线衍射在10–80°的宽2θ范围（Rigaku MiniFlex600，CuKα辐射）和0.6–6°的小2θ范围（布鲁克D8FOCUS，CuKα辐射）。使用扫描电子显微镜（SEM，JEOL JSM7500F）和透射电子显微镜（TEM，Philips Tecnai-F20）观察材料的形貌和微观结构。表面积和孔径分布是在BELSORP-mini仪器上通过N2吸附-解吸等温线测量的。

### Electrochemical investigation
CR2032 coin-type cells with a lithium plate anode were assembled in a glovebox filled with argon. The composite electrodes were made by blending 80 wt% H2bhnq/CMK-3 (mass ratio = 1 : 1) with 10 wt% of carbon black (Vulcan XC72, Cabot) and 10 wt% of polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) as a binder. The comparative H2bhnq electrodes were composed of 40 wt% H2bhnq, 50 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% PVDF. The electrolyte contained 1 M LiFP6 in ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate (EC–DMC, volume ratio 1 : 1). The charge–discharge experiments were carried out on a Land CT2001A cell testing system within the potential range of 1.8–3.3 V using different current rates. The capacities were calculated by only considering the active mass of the working electrodes as the carbon additive contributed negligibly to the overall capacity. Impedance measurements were conducted using a 2273 potentiostat/galvanostat workstation with an amplitude of 5 mV over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. All of the electrochemical tests were performed at room temperature.

## Results and discussion
### Material characterization
The elemental analysis, IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Fig. S1, S2 ESI†) of the obtained sample clearly indicate the successful synthesis of the target H2bhnq. From the result of the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†), H2bhnq exhibits a considerable thermal stability up to around 260 °C, which is an advantageous factor concerning the safety of organic electrode materials. The H2bhnq/CMK-3 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple impregnation method using a DMSO solvent. The interconnected mesoporous framework and high thermal stability of CMK-3 as well as the excellent solubility of H2bhnq in DMSO allow for both the high dispersion and high loading of H2bhnq.27,29,30Fig. 1 shows the wide-angle and low-angle XRD patterns of H2bhnq, CMK-3 and the H2bhnq/CMK-3 nanocomposite with a varied content of H2bhnq. As shown in Fig. 1a, no sharp diffraction peaks of H2bhnq can be observed when the weight ratio of H2bhnq was lower than 50%, which indicates that H2bhnq is highly dispersed in the pores of CMK-3 at the nanoscale.26,29 Such a highly dispersed amorphous state could improve the electrical conductivity of the composite. On further increasing the H2bhnq content, the peaks of H2bhnq gradually emerge, demonstrating the mixed state of the amorphous and crystalline structures in the composite.26,34 The low-angle XRD patterns in the 2θ range of 0.6–6° (Fig. 1b) display a similar trend. The sharp peak assigned to CMK-3 at 1.3° gradually declines as the content of H2bhnq is increased and disappears when the amount of H2bhnq is higher than 50 wt%, further proving the filling of the channels with H2bhnq.  
获得的样品的元素分析，IR，1H和13C NMR光谱（图S1，S2 ESI†）清楚地表明目标H2bhnq的合成成功。根据热重分析的结果（图S3，ESI†），H2bhnq在高达260°C的温度下显示出相当高的热稳定性，这是有关有机电极材料安全性的有利因素。 H2bhnq /CMK-3纳米复合材料是使用DMSO溶剂通过简单的浸渍方法制备的。互连的介孔骨架和CMK-3的高热稳定性，以及H2bhnq在DMSO中的出色溶解性，使得H2bhnq的高分散性和高载量得以实现。27、29、30。图1显示了具有不同含量的H2bhnq，CMK-3和H2bhnq /CMK-3纳米复合材料的广角和低角度XRD图。如图1a所示，当H2bhnq的重量比低于50％时，没有观察到H2bhnq的尖锐衍射峰，这表明H2bhnq在纳米级高度分散在CMK-3的孔中26,29高度分散的非晶态可以提高复合材料的电导率。随着H2bhnq含量的进一步增加，H2bhnq的峰逐渐出现，表明复合材料中非晶和晶体结构的混合状态。26,342θ范围为0.6–6°的低角度XRD图谱（图1b） ）显示相似的趋势。当H2bhnq的含量增加时，在1.3°处分配给CMK-3的尖峰逐渐降低，而当H2bhnq的含量高于50 wt％时消失，消失了，进一步证明了H2bhnq填充通道。

The specific surface areas of CMK-3 and a representative H2bhnq/CMK-3 (mass ratio = 1 : 1) composite were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 2a) and the corresponding pore size distribution (PSD, Fig. 2b) was determined using the BJH method. After the impregnation of H2bhnq, the BET surface area decreases from 1084.5 to 54.9 m2 g−1, while the mesoporous volume drops from 1.09 to 0.20 cm3 g−1. These results provide further evidence to support the fact that the H2bhnq molecules were accommodated in the mesopores of CMK-3.34

The morphology change of CMK-3 before and after impregnation is investigated using SEM. CMK-3 materials have an extremely high surface area and a highly ordered porous structure, which give them the appearance of nanochanneled carbon scaffolds (Fig. 3a).28,30 However, after impregnation of 50 wt% H2bhnq, the surface of CMK-3 turns smooth (Fig. 3b), indicating the filling of H2bhnq in the nanochannels of CMK-3. Moreover, when the content of H2bhnq reached higher than 50 wt%, the excess bulk H2bhnq was presented in the form of crystals, as can be clearly seen in the SEM image (Fig. S4, ESI†). This indicates that the channel of CMK-3 was fully filled, which is in conformity with the wide-angle XRD results. The filling of the carbon channels with H2bhnq was further verified by a TEM image. Uniform channels with a diameter of 6–7 nm are evident in the TEM image of pure CMK-3 (Fig. 3c) but largely vanish after impregnation (Fig. 3d). More importantly, no bulk H2bhnq particles were observed on the external surface, which suggests that the incorporation of H2bhnq is restricted to the inner pores of CMK-3.34  
使用SEM研究了CMK-3在浸渍前后的形态变化。 CMK-3材料具有极高的表面积和高度有序的多孔结构，使其具有纳米通道碳支架的外观（图3a）。28,30然而，在浸渍50 wt％的H2bhnq后，CMK-3的表面3圈变得平滑（图3b），表明H2bhnq在CMK-3纳米通道中的填充。此外，当H2bhnq的含量超过50 wt％时，过量的H2bhnq会以晶体形式出现，如在SEM图像中可以清楚地看到（图S4，ESI†）。这表明CMK-3的通道已完全充满，这与广角XRD结果一致。通过TEM图像进一步证实了用H 2 bhnq填充碳通道。直径为6–7 nm的均匀通道在纯CMK-3的TEM图像中很明显（图3c），但在浸渍后会消失（图3d）。更重要的是，在外表面未观察到大量的H2bhnq颗粒，这表明H2bhnq的掺入仅限于CMK-3.34的内孔

图3.含50 wt％H2bhnq（b，d）的CMK-3（a，c）和H2bhnq /CMK-3的SEM图像（a，b）和TEM图像（c，d）。

Based on the above results, the H2bhnq molecules were successfully anchored into the pore channels of CMK-3 ordered mesoporous carbon through the facile impregnation method. When the mass ratio of H2bhnq reaches 50%, the pores are almost fully filled. The density of H2bhnq is 1.50 g cm−3. The pore volume of CMK-3 is 1.09 cm3 g−1, according to the BET test. It is noted that a maximum of 1.63 g (ms = vp × ρH2bhnq) of H2bhnq can be impregnated into the pores of 1.00 g of CMK-3. The weight ratio of H2bhnq was adjusted to be less than 62% to provide a transport pathway for the Li+ ions and to allow for the expansion of the pore content on full lithiation to Li4H2bhnq. Thus, the synthesized H2bhnq/CMK-3 composite with 50 wt% H2bhnq (denoted as H2bhnq/CMK-3 hereafter) was selected as a cathode material for the electrochemical test.  
基于上述结果，H2bhnq分子通过简便的浸渍方法成功地锚定在CMK-3有序介孔碳的孔道中。当H2bhnq的质量比达到50％时，孔几乎被完全填充。H2bhnq的密度为1.50 g cm-3。根据BET测试，CMK-3的孔体积为1.09 cm3 g-1。注意，最大1.63 g（ms = vp×ρH2bhnq）的H2bhnq可以浸入1.00 g CMK-3的孔中。将H2bhnq的重量比调整为小于62％，以提供Li+离子的传输途径，并允许在完全锂化时扩大孔含量到Li4H2bhnq。因此，选择具有50重量％的H2bhnq的合成H2bhnq/CMK-3复合材料（以下称为H 2 bhnq /CMK-3）作为用于电化学测试的阴极材料。

### Electrochemical performance
Fig. 4a–b shows the charge and discharge curves of the neat H2bhnq and the H2bhnq/CMK-3 composite. Different capacity–voltage profiles can be observed. For H2bhnq, the discharge curve has a flat voltage plateau at about 2.95 V, which is followed by relatively slopping plateaus. The average charge and discharge voltages are 2.53 and 2.36 V, respectively. The H2bhnq/CMK-3 composite electrode exhibits slopping charge–discharge curves without an apparent plateaus and with average charge–discharge voltages of 2.48/2.30 V. This feature of the charge–discharge curves suggests the prominent nanosize effect35,36 on the electrochemical behaviour of H2bhnq that is confined in the nanosized channel of the carbon scaffold. The initial discharge capacities of H2bhnq and the nanocomposite are 285.6 and 308.6 mAh g−1, respectively. The latter capacity is extremely close to the theoretical value of 309.6 mAh g−1, demonstrating that the use of the CMK-3 scaffold enables the full utilization of H2bhnq, of which each carbonyl functional group reacts with one lithium to form a lithium enolate (Scheme 1). Meanwhile, H2bhnq displays a high-specific energy of 715 W h kg−1 (based on the mass of active materials), which is compared favourably to other organic carbonyl compounds.24  
**图4a–b显示了纯净的H2bhnq和H2bhnq /CMK-3复合材料的充放电曲线**。可以观察到不同的容量-电压曲线。对于H2bhnq，放电曲线在约2.95 V处具有平坦的电压平稳段，随后是相对倾斜的平稳段。平均充电和放电电压分别为2.53和2.36V。 H2bhnq/CMK-3复合电极表现出倾斜的充放电曲线，没有明显的平稳状态，平均充放电电压为2.48/2.30V。此充放电曲线的这一特征表明，纳米粒子对电化学行为具有显着的影响[3​​5,36]。 H2bhnq被限制在碳支架的纳米通道中。 H2bhnq和纳米复合材料的初始放电容量分别为285.6和308.6 mAh g-1。后者的容量非常接近309.6 mAh g-1的理论值，表明使用CMK-3支架可以充分利用H2bhnq，H2bhnq的每个羰基官能团均与一个锂反应形成烯醇锂（方案1）。同时，H2bhnq显示出715 W h kg-1的高比能（基于活性材料的质量），与其他有机羰基化合物相比具有优势24。

The cycling performance of the electrodes made with H2bhnq and H2bhnq/CMK-3 is measured at 0.1 C rate. As shown in Fig. 4c, the capacity of H2bhnq decreases rapidly after the first cycle. After 50 cycles, the discharge capacity only remains at 75.2 mAh g−1, corresponding to a capacity fading of 73.7%. The poor cycling stability is ascribed to the dissolution of H2bhnq into the electrolyte,11 which is confirmed by the fact that the electrolyte turns red after charge–discharge testing. However, a much better stability upon cycling has been observed for H2bhnq/CMK-3. After 50 cycles, a much higher capacity of 202.6 mAh g−1 is maintained. Meanwhile, the initial charge–discharge Coulombic efficiency of the composite is 85.9%, which is higher than that of H2bhnq (81.5%). After several cycles, the Coulombic efficiency can reach higher than 99%. All the results illustrate that the encapsulation of H2bhnq into CMK-3 could effectively inhibit the dissolution of H2bhnq and thus improves its cycle stability.  
用H2bhnq和H2bhnq/CMK-3制成的电极的循环性能在0.1 C速率下测量。如图4c所示，在第一个循环后，H2bhnq的容量迅速降低。**在50次循环之后，放电容量仅保持在75.2mAh g-1，对应于73.7％的容量衰减。循环稳定性差的原因是H2bhnq溶解在电解液中11，这可以通过以下事实得到证实：电解液在充放电测试后变成红色**。然而，对于H2bhnq /CMK-3，已经观察到循环时更好的稳定性。经过50个循环后，可以维持更高的容量，即202.6 mAh g-1。同时，复合材料的初始充放电库仑效率为85.9％，高于H2bhnq（81.5％）。经过几个循环后，库仑效率可以达到99％以上。所有结果表明，将H2bhnq封装到CMK-3中可以有效抑制H2bhnq的溶解，从而提高其循环稳定性。

The rate performance of H2bhnq and H2bhnq/CMK-3 was also tested (Fig. 4d). Compared to neat H2bhnq, the composite sample exhibited a much better rate capability. The discharge capacities at 0.5 C are 154.3 and 245.8 mAh g−1 for H2bhnq and H2bhnq/CMK-3, respectively. At a high rate of 10 C, for which the electronic conductivity of the electrode materials is crucial,21–24 the discharge capacity of the nanocomposite is approximately 4 times higher than that of H2bhnq. The improved rate performance of the composite derives from the high conductivity and the ordered porous channels of CMK-3, which ensure the facile electron and ion transport.37  
还测试了H2bhnq和H2bhnq/CMK-3的速率性能（图4d）。与纯净的H2bhnq相比，该复合样品具有更好的速率能力。 H2bhnq和H2bhnq/CMK-3在0.5 C下的放电容量分别为154.3和245.8 mAh g-1。在10 C的高速率下，电极材料的电子电导率至关重要，21–24纳米复合材料的放电容量比H2bhnq高约4倍。复合材料提高的倍率性能源于CMK-3的高电导率和有序的多孔通道，可确保便捷的电子和离子传输37。

To further understand the role of CMK-3 in the composite, the structure of the electrode materials after the charge–discharge cycles was characterized by SEM and TEM. The SEM images (Fig. S5, ESI†) show that the morphology of CMK-3 was essentially preserved after the charge–discharge progress, suggesting the high structural stability of CMK-3. This could guarantee the integrity of the composite electrode during the electrochemical test. The TEM image of the nanocomposite after 50 cycles also shows a rodlike morphology (Fig. 5), which is in good agreement with the SEM result. It should be noted that no porous channel structure can be observed on the composite sample, implying that H2bhnq is well confined within the pores of CMK-3 during the whole charge–discharge process, consequently prolonging the cycle life of the composite electrode.  
为了进一步了解CMK-3在复合材料中的作用，通过SEM和TEM表征了充放电循环后电极材料的结构。 SEM图像（图S5，ESI†）表明，在充放电过程之后CMK-3的形态基本得以保留，这表明CMK-3具有很高的结构稳定性。这可以保证在电化学测试过程中复合电极的完整性。 50个循环后，纳米复合材料的TEM图像也显示出棒状形态（图5），与SEM结果非常吻合。应该注意的是，在复合样品上没有观察到多孔通道结构，这意味着在整个充放电过程中，H2bhnq很好地被限制在CMK-3的孔内，从而延长了复合电极的循环寿命。

In order to analyze the difference of the rate properties between H2bhnq and H2bhnq/CMK-3, the impedance spectra of the two electrodes after different cycles were collected (Fig. 6). All of the profiles show a semicircle in the high-frequency regions and an inclined line in the low-frequency region. The semicircle can be assigned to the combination of the charge-transfer resistances at the electrode surface and the double-layer capacitance between the electrolyte and the cathode.38,39 The impedances increase with the cycle number for the first several cycles and then decrease for both samples. This phenomenon is relevant to the dissolution of active materials and agrees well with the previous report.26 It is worth noting that the charge transfer resistance of H2bhnq is much higher than that of the nanocomposite at the same cycle, indicating that the conductivity can be greatly enhanced after the uniform dispersion of H2bhnq in the CMK-3 nanopores owing to the high conductivity of the carbon framework.40  
为了分析H2bhnq和H2bhnq /CMK-3之间的速率特性差异，收集了两个电极在不同循环后的阻抗谱（图6）。所有轮廓均在高频区域显示半圆，在低频区域显示倾斜线。可以将半圆指定为电极表面的电荷转移电阻与电解质和阴极之间的双层电容的组合。38,39在最初的几个循环中，阻抗随循环数的增加而增加，而对于两个样本。这种现象与活性物质的溶解有关，并且与先前的报道非常吻合。26值得注意的是，在相同的循环中，H2bhnq的电荷转移电阻远高于纳米复合材料，这表明电导率可以大大提高。 H2bhnq在CMK-3纳米孔中均匀分散后，由于碳骨架的高电导率而得到增强40。

Therefore, the use of CMK-3 is effective to enhance the electrode performance of H2bhnq, which is attributed to the following aspects. Firstly, the high dispersion of H2bhnq in the channels of CMK-3 reduces the dimension of the H2bhnq into the nanoscale and thus provides more active sites for the electrode reactions, enabling the full utilization of the active mass. Secondly, the small channels of CMK-3 greatly restrict the dissolution of the well enwrapped H2bhnq, ensuring the long cycle life of the composite electrode. Thirdly, CMK-3 acts as a substrate offering a sufficient percolation network for electrons and the nanosized H2bhnq shortens the Li-ion transport distance, resulting in a high rate performance. These unique beneficial factors make H2bhnq/CMK-3 a promising nanocomposite to enhance the electrochemical performance. It is noted that the carbon content of 50 wt% is slightly higher than the active materials and this could limit the overall capacity of the electrode. A further optimization of the electrode composition to increase the overall capacity of the electrode is in the study.  
因此，CMK-3的使用有效地增强了H2bhnq的电极性能，这归因于以下方面。首先，**H2bhnq在CMK-3通道中的高度分散减小了H2bhnq进入纳米级的尺寸，因此为电极反应提供了更多的活性位点**，从而可以充分利用活性物质。其次，**CMK-3的小通道极大地限制了包裹良好的H2bhnq的溶解，从而确保了复合电极的长循环寿命**。第三，**CMK-3充当底物，为电子提供足够的渗流网络，纳米级的H2bhnq缩短了锂离子的传输距离，从而实现了高倍率性能**。这些独特的有益因素使H2bhnq /CMK-3成为增强电化学性能的有前途的纳米复合材料。注意50wt％的碳含量略高于活性材料，这可能限制电极的总容量。研究中进一步优化了电极成分以增加电极的总容量。

## Conclusions
A facile impregnation method was employed to incorporate the H2bhnq molecules into the pore channels of ordered mesoporous CMK-3. Different instrumental analyses have demonstrated the successful loading of H2bhnq within the pores of CMK-3. The H2bhnq/CMK-3 nanocomposite with 50 wt% H2bhnq can provide a discharge capacity of 308.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C in the first cycle. The capacity was kept at 202.6 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles. At a high rate of 10 C, reversible capacities of 124.0 mAh g−1 are obtained. The results suggest that confining organic electrode materials in inorganic CMK-3 could not only improve the conductivity, but also protect them from dissolving into the electrolyte. This work should enlighten the application of inorganic–organic nanocomposites such as organic carbonyl materials in CMK-3 for advanced lithium-ion batteries.  
采用一种简便的浸渍方法将H2bhnq分子掺入有序介孔CMK-3的孔道中。不同的仪器分析表明，H2bhnq已成功加载到CMK-3孔中。 H2bhnq /CMK-3纳米复合材料具有50 wt％的H2bhnq，在第一个循环中在0.1 C时可提供308.6 mAh g-1的放电容量。 50次循环后，容量保持在202.6 mAh g-1。在10 C的高速率下，可获得124.0 mAh g-1的可逆容量。结果表明，将有机电极材料限制在无机CMK-3中不仅可以提高电导率，还可以保护它们不溶于电解质。这项工作应该会启发无机有机纳米复合材料（例如有机羰基材料）在CMK-3中用于高级锂离子电池的应用。
