## Abstract
Here, we report that spherical C60 derivatives with well-defined molecular structures hold great promise to be advanced anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We studied four C60 molecules with various functional groups, including pristine, carboxyl, ester, and piperazine C60. The comparison of these C60s elucidated a strong correlation between functional group, overall packing (crystallinity), and the anode performance in LIBs. Specifically, carboxyl C60 and neutral ester C60 showed higher charge capacities than pristine C60, whereas positively-charged piperazine C60 exhibited lower capacity. The highest charge capacity was achieved on the carboxyl C60 (861 mAh g−1 at 100th cycle), which is five times higher than that of pristine C60 (170 mAh g−1), more than double the theoretical capacity of commercial graphite (372 mAh g−1), and even higher than the theoretical capacity of graphene (744 mAh g−1). Carboxyl C60 also showed a high capacity at a fast discharge-charge rate (370 mAh g−1 at 5 C). The exceptional performance of carboxyl C60 can be attributed to multiple key factors. They include the complex formation between lithium ions and oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group, the improved lithium-binding capability of C60 cage due to electron donating from carboxylate groups, the electrostatic attraction between carboxylate groups and lithium ions, and the large lattice void space and high specific area due to carboxyl functionalization. This study indicates that, while maintaining the basic C60 electronic and geometric properties, functionalization with desired groups can achieve remarkably enhanced capacity and rate performance for lithium storage.  
在这里，我们报道具有良好定义的分子结构的球形C60衍生物有望成为锂离子电池（LIB）的先进阳极材料。我们研究了具有不同官能团的四个C60分子，包括原始，羧基，酯和哌嗪C60。这些C60的比较阐明了LIB中官能团，整体堆积（结晶度）和阳极性能之间的强烈关联。具体地，羧基C60和中性酯C60显示出比原始C60更高的充电容量，而带正电荷的哌嗪C60显示出更低的容量。羧基C60的最高充电容量（第100个循环时为861 mAh g-1），是原始C60（170 mAh g-1）的五倍，是商品石墨理论容量（372）的两倍以上mAh g-1），甚至高于石墨烯的理论容量（744 mAh g-1）。羧基C60在快速充电速率下（5 C时为370 mAh g-1）也显示出高容量。羧基C60的出色性能可归因于多个关键因素。它们包括锂离子和羧基上的氧原子之间的复杂形成，由于羧酸盐基团给电子而改善的C60笼型锂结合能力，羧酸盐基团和锂离子之间的静电引力以及较大的晶格空隙空间和由于羧基官能化，比表面积大。这项研究表明，在保持基本的C60电子和几何特性的同时，用所需基团进行官能化可以显着提高锂存储的容量和倍率性能。

## 1. Introduction
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been considered as key candidates for energy storage and power supply for applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In particular, the ever-increasing demand in electric vehicles has greatly promoted the research interests for developing advanced LIBs with high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and cycling stability [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Carbon-based anode materials have raised a great deal of interests due to their low-cost and light-weight (i.e. high energy density). However, graphite, the most commonly studied anode materials for LIBs has some drawbacks such as low theoretical specific capacity (372 mAh g−1), lack of long term stability, and poor rate performance [13], [14], [15], [16]. To this aim, many efforts have been devoted to developing anode materials, such as carbon allotropy, silicon, metal oxides, and organic compounds [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].  
锂离子电池（LIB）已被认为是便携式电子设备和电动汽车中的能量存储和电源供应的主要候选对象[1]，[2]，[3]，[4]，[5]，[6] 。特别是，对电动汽车的不断增长的需求极大地促进了对开发具有高可逆容量，出色的倍率性能和循环稳定性的先进LIB的研究兴趣[7]，[8]，[9]，[10]，[ 11]，[12]。碳基负极材料由于其低成本和轻量（即高能量密度）而引起了很多兴趣。然而，最常研究的LIB阳极材料石墨具有一些缺点，例如理论比容量低（372 mAh g-1），缺乏长期稳定性和差的速率性能[13]，[14]，[15] ，[16]。为了这个目的，已经致力于开发阳极材料，例如碳同素异形体，硅，金属氧化物和有机化合物[17]，[18]，[19]，[20]，[21]，[22]。 ，[23]，[24]，[25]，[26]，[27]，[28]。

Among various anode materials, carbon-based LIBs have gained extensive attention because metallic lithium is replaced by a carbon host structure that can reversibly absorb and release lithium ions at low electrochemical potentials [29], [30], [31]. In addition, in contrast to their inorganic counterparts, carbon based materials have the advantages of low-cost, lightweight, and the ability to be functionalized with tunable electrical, electronic and redox properties. Improved cycling stability and capacity have been achieved by using nanoporous and heteroatom-doped carbon materials with various microstructures, such as graphene [32], [33], [34], graphene nanoribbons [35], carbon nanotubes [36], [37], nanofibers [7], [38], nanobeads [39], hollow nanospheres [40], porous carbon [41], [42], [43], carbon nanoparticles [44], porous carbon cloth [45], and their hybrids [46], [47]. Despite all the advancements in optimizing the above carbon-based materials, their structural heterogeneity remains a challenge for lack of control over their structures at the molecular level. Thus, the underlying mechanisms responsible for those improvements have not been well established, which hinders a greater understanding between the structure and LIB properties of materials [48], [49], [50]. For example, reduced graphene oxides have ill-defined molecular structures with a lot of defects; therefore, it is not possible to establish structure–property relationships and raises a great concern over their performance reproducibility.  
在各种负极材料中，基于碳的LIB受到了广泛的关注，因为金属锂被碳基质结构所取代，该碳基质结构可以在低电化学势下可逆地吸收和释放锂离子[29]，[30]，[31]。此外，与无机材料相比，碳基材料具有成本低，重量轻的优势，并且具有可调节的电，电子和氧化还原特性，能够进行功能化。通过使用具有各种微结构的纳米多孔和杂原子掺杂碳材料，例如石墨烯[32]，[33]，[34]，石墨烯纳米带[35]，碳纳米管[36]，[37]，可以提高循环稳定性和容量。 ]，纳米纤维[7]，[38]，纳米珠[39]，空心纳米球[40]，多孔碳[41]，[42]，[43]，碳纳米颗粒[44]，多孔碳布[45]和他们的杂种[46]，[47]。尽管在优化上述碳基材料方面取得了所有进步，但是由于缺乏在分子水平上对其结构的控制，它们的结构异质性仍然是一个挑战。因此，导致这些改善的潜在机制尚未得到很好的建立，这阻碍了人们对材料的结构和LIB特性之间的更多了解[48]，[49]，[50]。例如，还原的氧化石墨烯氧化物的分子结构不明确，存在很多缺陷。因此，不可能建立结构与属性的关系，并引起对其性能可再现性的极大关注。

Notably, most of previously studied carbon materials for LIBs are layered structures, such as graphite and graphene, presumably allow for facile diffusion and incorporation of lithium ions. Unlike many layer-structured carbon materials, C60 has a precisely-defined zero-dimensional spherical structure. The C60 molecule is composed of a carbon cage with 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons on its surface [51], [52]. The pure C60 and its derivatives can be synthesized with precisions down to the molecular level, and hence alleviate the aforementioned structural heterogeneity issue associated with many carbon materials. Since their discovery, C60-based fullerenes have been extensively studied primarily for biomedical applications [53], [54] and for the electron transport layers in photovoltaic devices [55], [56], [57]. Chabre et al., first reported that C60 may be used for LIBs as they showed electrochemical intercalation of lithium into solid C60, suggesting that each C60 molecule can bind with 12 lithium to form C60Li12 corresponding to a capacity of 446 mAh/g [58]. In addition, the capacity of C60 molecule can be increased by hydrogenation of C60 at 1200 mAh/g [59]. However, it is very important to note that hydrogenated C60 does not have any electronic and/or optical properties of C60. It is simply a hydrocarbon with a caged structure. Lacking of experimental details and structural data of hydrogenated C60 from this report, it is simply not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on how C60 can be modified to render a much improved energy storage materials.  
值得注意的是，以前研究的大多数用于LIB的碳材料都是层状结构，例如石墨和石墨烯，大概可以方便地扩散和掺入锂离子。与许多层状碳材料不同，C60具有精确定义的零维球形结构。 C60分子由在其表面上具有20个六边形和12个五边形的碳笼组成[51]，[52]。可以以低至分子水平的精度合成纯C60及其衍生物，因此可以减轻与许多碳材料相关的上述结构异质性问题。自发现以来，基于C60的富勒烯已被广泛研究，主要用于生物医学应用[53]，[54]和光伏器件中的电子传输层[55]，[56]，[57]。 Chabre等人首先报道了C60可用于LIB，因为它们显示出锂可电化学插入固体C60中，表明每个C60分子可与12个锂结合形成C60Li12，对应容量为446 mAh /g [58]。 。此外，可以通过以1200 mAh /g的速度氢化C60来提高C60分子的容量[59]。但是，非常重要的一点是，氢化的C60不具有C60的任何电子和/或光学性质。它只是具有笼状结构的碳氢化合物。由于缺少该报告的氢化C60的实验细节和结构数据，因此根本不可能得出有意义的结论，说明如何对C60进行改性以提供大大改善的储能材料。

In recent years, C60 has been used as the additive to boost the charge capacity of reduced graphene oxide/graphite in LIBs because C60 can function as a spacer to increase inter-layer distances between graphene layers and to facilitate the incorporation of lithium ions [48]. In addition, C60 based polymers were mixed with silicon powders to increase the stability of silicon based LIBs [60]. However, there is no systematic study about the relationship between the functional groups and device performance in carbon-based LIBs. The structure-property correlation would be extremely helpful to provide insights for optimizing and exploring new materials for next generation LIBs.  
近年来，C60已被用作添加剂来增强LIB中还原的氧化石墨烯/石墨的电荷容量，因为C60可以充当间隔物，从而增加石墨烯层之间的层间距离并促进锂离子的掺入[48]。 ]。另外，将C60基聚合物与硅粉混合以提高硅基LIB的稳定性[60]。然而，关于碳基锂离子电池中官能团与器件性能之间的关系，尚无系统的研究。结构属性相关性将非常有助于为优化和探索下一代LIB的新材料提供见解。

In this work, we report for the first time a systematic study on spherical C60 and its derivatives with well-defined molecular structures as anode materials for LIBs. Four different C60 derivatives including pristine C60, ester C60, carboxyl C60, and positively-charged piperazine C60 were used as anode materials to study their performances in LIBs (Fig. 1a). The structures of these C60 and C60 derivatives were synthesized and characterized. Their molecular and hierarchical structures have been confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–visible spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The carboxyl C60 and ester C60 showed much higher lithium storage capacity than pristine C60 presumably due to the O˭C-O functional groups, which not only provide the binding sites for lithium ions, but also change the electronic and crystalline structures, surface charge, and specific surface area of C60 to improve the capacity of C60 derivatives. In contrast, the highly-crystalline pristine C60 and positively-charged piperazine C60 have an adverse effect on the capacity. These strong correlations between functionalized groups in C60 and LIB performances suggest that C60 with desired functionality at the molecular level can achieve significantly enhanced lithium-ion storage capacity.  
在这项工作中，我们首次报告了对球形C60及其衍生物（具有明确定义的分子结构）作为LIB阳极材料的系统研究。四种不同的C60衍生物，包括原始C60，酯C60，羧基C60和带正电荷的哌嗪C60被用作阳极材料，以研究它们在LIB中的性能（图1a）。合成并表征了这些C60和C60衍生物的结构。它们的分子和层级结构已通过核磁共振波谱（NMR），透射电子显微镜（TEM），紫外可见光谱和X射线衍射（XRD）进行了确认。羧基C60和酯C60的锂存储容量比原始C60高得多，这可能是由于O˭CO官能团所致，它们不仅提供了锂离子的结合位点，而且还改变了电子和晶体结构，表面电荷和比重。 C60的表面积提高了C60衍生物的容量。相反，高度结晶的原始C60和带正电荷的哌嗪C60对容量有不利影响。 C60中的官能团与LIB性能之间的这些强相关性表明，在分子水平上具有所需官能度的C60可以显着提高锂离子的储存能力。

The resulting mixture was stirred in air under irradiation from the top by 60 W incandescent light bulb. The course of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and stopped when conversion of C60 was complete. The reaction was then diluted by toluene (1:7 by volume) and poured into large amount of n-hexane to precipitate the unreacted fullerene.

### 2.4. Fabrication of LIBs and LIB tests
The battery tests were performed with CR2025-type coin cells containing the C60 or C60 derivatives working electrode. The working electrodes were prepared by a slurry coating method with 60 wt% of sample, 30 wt% conductive acetylene black, and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The mass of each C60 and C60 derivatives thin film electrode was precisely measured with a microbalance before coin cell assembly. Coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with a metallic lithium foil as the combined reference and counter electrodes. The moisture content and oxygen level in the glove box were maintained less than 1 ppm. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of EC/DMC with Celgard 2300 polypropylene as separator. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged at a constant current density of 0.1 C based on the weight of the pristine C60 or C60 derivative sample on a battery test system (Arbin 2000-BT) for galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling tests ranging from 0.02 to 3.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on an electrochemistry workstation (CHI 760E) over the potential range 0.02 – 3.0 V vs. Li/Li + at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s− 1.  
电池测试是使用包含C60或C60衍生物工作电极的CR2025型纽扣电池进行的。通过淤浆涂覆法将工作电极用分散在N-甲基-2-吡咯烷酮（NMP）中的60 wt％的样品，30 wt％的导电乙炔黑和10 wt％的聚偏二氟乙烯（PVDF）粘合剂制备。在组装硬币电池之前，用微量天平精确测量每个C60和C60衍生物薄膜电极的质量。将币形电池组装在装有金属锂箔作为组合参比电极和反电极的充氩气的手套箱中。手套箱中的水分含量和氧气含量保持在1 ppm以下。电解质为EC /DMC与Celgard 2300聚丙烯作为隔膜的1：1（v /v）混合物中的1 M LiPF6。根据电池测试系统（Arbin 2000-BT）上原始C60或C60衍生物样品的重量，对电池进行恒电流充电和放电，恒定电流密度为0.1 C，用于恒电流放电－充电循环测试，范围为0.02至3.0 V.循环伏安法测量是在电化学工作站（CHI 760E）上在相对于Li /Li +的0.02 – 3.0 V电位范围内以0.1 mV s-1的扫描速率进行的。

### 2.5. Calculation of specific capacity of C60 and C60 derivatives
The specific capacity of C60 and C60 derivatives can be calculated by the following formula:
$Ct(mA⋅h⋅g−1)=n×F(C⋅mol−1)Mw(g⋅mol−1)=n×96485(C)Mw(g)=n×96485(A⋅s)Mw(g)=n×96485×1000/3600(mA⋅h)Mw(g)=26801×nMwmA⋅h⋅g−1
$

in the formula, Ct, n, F and Mw represents the theoretical specific capacity, the transferred electron number in each structural unit, the Faraday constant and the molecular weight of the structural unit, respectively. The molecular weights of C60, ester C60, carboxyl C60, and positive piperazine C60 are 720, 2094.84, 1332, 1176.48, respectively.  
式中，Ct，n，F和Mw分别代表理论比容量，每个结构单元中的转移电子数，法拉第常数和该结构单元的分子量。 C60，酯C60，羧基C60和正哌嗪C60的分子量分别为720、2094.84、1332、1176.48。

It was found that the number of lithium intercalated in one C60 could reach 12 by electrochemical studies [58]. Based on this, the calculated the capacity of C60 is 446 mAh g−1. For ester C60, 12 carbonyl group in ester C60 can bind 12 lithium ions and C60 can bind 12 lithium ions (Li12C60), so the calculated capacity of ester C60 is 307 mAh g−1. For carboxyl C60 anode, 12 of carboxyl group may bind 12 lithium ions [64], and the C60 core could complex 12 lithium ions [58]. So the total number of lithium ion storage could be 24 for one carboxyl C60 and the corresponding calculated capacity of lithium storage is 483 mAh g−1.  
通过电化学研究发现，嵌入到一个C60中的锂数量可以达到12个[58]。基于此，计算出的C60容量为446 mAh g-1。对于酯C60，酯C60中的12个羰基可以结合12个锂离子，而C60可以结合12个锂离子（Li12C60），因此酯C60的计算容量为307 mAh g-1。对于羧基C60阳极，羧基中的12个可以结合12个锂离子[64]，而C60核可以与12个锂离子络合[58]。因此，一个羧基C60的锂离子存储总数为24，相应的锂存储计算容量为483 mAh g-1。

## 3. Results and discussion
### 3.1. Synthesis and structural characterization of functionalized C60s
Ester C60 and carboxyl C60, were synthesized by following the literature procedures [61], [62]. Briefly, ester C60 was made by treating deoxygenated C60 solution with sodium naphthalenide and excess amount of di-tert-butyl 2-bromo-2-methylmalonate. Carboxyl C60 was prepared by the hydrolysis of C60[C(CO2Et)2]6, which was made by the treatment of C60 with 9,10-dimethylanthracene, CBr4, diethyl malonate, and excess amount of 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. Piperazine C60 was synthesized by reacting C60(N-methylpiperazine)4 with iodomethane, in which C60(N-methylpiperazine)4 was prepared by treating C60 with 1-methylpiperazine in 1,2-dichlorobenzene [63]. The molecular structures of these three C60 derivative were confirmed by 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1 – S3 in Supporting information).  
按照文献程序[61]，[62]合成酯C60和羧基C60。简而言之，通过用萘酸钠和过量的2-溴-2-甲基丙二酸二叔丁酯处理脱氧的C60溶液来制备酯C60。羧基C60是通过水解C60 [C（CO2Et）2] 6制备的，该水解反应是通过用9,10-二甲基蒽，CBr4，丙二酸二乙酯和过量的1,8-二氮杂双环-[5.4]处理C60制备的.0] undec-7-ene。哌嗪C60是通过使C60（N-甲基哌嗪）4与碘甲烷反应而合成的，其中C60（N-甲基哌嗪）4是通过在1,2-二氯苯中用1-甲基哌嗪处理C60制备的。这三种C60衍生物的分子结构已通过13C NMR光谱法确认（支持信息中的图S1-S3）。

The structures of four C60 and C60 derivatives are shown in Fig. 1b. Pristine C60 is molecule, without any functional group. Carboxyl C60 and ester C60 has 12 carboxyl and ester groups, respectively. Piperazine C60 has four positively-charged sites (ammonium salt) distributed on the northern hemisphere of the C60 (Fig. 1b) and hence is the only one with an asymmetric structure. Functionalization of C60 leads to modification of electronic structures and the optical images of the fullerene solutions reveal distinct colors (Fig. 1b), consistent with their corresponding UV–visible absorption spectra (see Fig. 2a) that will be elaborated later.  
四种C60和C60衍生物的结构如图1b所示。原始C60是分子，没有任何官能团。羧基C60和酯C60分别具有12个羧基和酯基。哌嗪C60在C60的北半球分布有四个带正电荷的位置（铵盐）（图1b），因此是唯一具有不对称结构的位置。 C60的功能化导致电子结构的改变，富勒烯溶液的光学图像显示出不同的颜色（图1b），与它们相应的紫外可见吸收光谱（见图2a）一致，这将在以后进行阐述。

In Fig. 2a, pristine C60 has two prominent absorption peaks at 257 nm and 331 nm, which are typical for π - π* transitions in aromatic systems [65]. Ester C60 has three obvious peaks at 250 nm, 358 nm and 853 nm. The 853 nm peak arises from the fully conjugated equatorial tranulene structure [61], [66]. Carboxyl C60 has two shoulder bands around 331 nm and 313 nm, and strong absorption bands at 246 nm, 270 nm, and 279 nm [62]. The above spectra are in good agreement with those reported in previous literatures. As for piperazine C60, it only shows one main absorption peak at 254 nm, presumably due to a highly asymmetric structure that disrupts the conjugation in the molecule.  
在图2a中，原始C60在257 nm和331 nm处有两个突出的吸收峰，这是芳族系统中π-π*跃迁的典型峰[65]。酯C60在250nm，358nm和853nm处具有三个明显的峰。 853 nm峰来自完全共轭的赤道torial结构[61]，[66]。羧基C60在331 nm和313 nm处有两个肩带，在246 nm，270 nm和279 nm处有很强的吸收带[62]。上述光谱与先前文献中报道的光谱非常吻合。对于哌嗪C60，它仅在254 nm处显示一个主吸收峰，这可能是由于高度不对称的结构破坏了分子的结合。

The XRD was used for characterizing the crystalline structure of four different C60s (Fig. 2b). Pristine C60 shows very strong (111), (220), and (311) peaks associated with single crystalline C60, consistent with the results reported previously [67]. In contrast, ester C60 and carboxyl C60 show significantly reduced crystalline structure, as manifested by the much weaker diffraction patterns as compared to pristine C60. Notably, ester C60 and carboxyl C60 have relatively sharp peaks in smaller angles of 6.1° and 7.0°, respectively, due to increased inter-C60 separation by the functional groups. The disruption of crystalline structure is particularly prominent in the case of piperazine C60 due to its structural asymmetry, which inhibits crystalline packing at various length scales. As a result, the XRD of piperazine C60 reveals an amorphous structure with only two broad peaks centered around 7° and 18° (Fig. 2b).  
XRD用于表征四种不同C60的晶体结构（图2b）。原始C60显示与单晶C60相关的非常强的（111），（220）和（311）峰，与先前报道的结果一致[67]。相反，酯C60和羧基C60显示出明显降低的晶体结构，这与原始C60相比明显弱得多。值得注意的是，由于官能团之间的C60间隔增加，酯C60和羧基C60在6.1°和7.0°的较小角度分别具有相对尖锐的峰。在哌嗪C60的情况下，由于其结构不对称，晶体结构的破坏特别突出，其在各种长度尺度上抑制了晶体堆积。结果，哌嗪C60的X射线衍射显示出一种无定形结构，只有两个宽峰位于7°和18°附近（图2b）。

The TEM images are consistent with XRD results. In Fig. 2c, the TEM image of pristine C60 shows a perfect crystalline pattern with about 1.0 nm center-to-center distance between the molecules, consistent with the previous study [68]. The TEM image of ester C60 (Fig. 2d) and carboxyl C60 (Fig. 2e) only show some streaking patterns, which are consistent with the much weaker peaks in their corresponding XRD spectra. Piperazine C60 shows no structural order in its TEM image (Fig. 2f), again consistent with the two broad peaks in its XRD spectrum.  
TEM图像与XRD结果一致。在图2c中，原始C60的TEM图像显示了一个完美的晶体图案，分子之间的中心距约为1.0 nm，与先前的研究一致[68]。酯C60（图2d）和羧基C60（图2e）的TEM图像仅显示出一些条纹图案，这与其相应的XRD光谱中的弱得多的峰一致。哌嗪C60在其TEM图像中未显示结构顺序（图2f），再次与其XRD光谱中的两个宽峰一致。

Electrochemical cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and specific surface area measurements on C60 and its derivatives (Fig. S4 and Table S1 in Supporting information) also revealed changes dominated by the nature and the regiochemistry of the functional groups. Such molecular-level-tunable structural, electronic and electrochemical properties in these C60 and C60 derivatives are expected to significantly impact their performances in LIBs, as will be examined below.  
电化学循环伏安图（CV）和C60及其衍生物的比表面积测量（支持信息中的图S4和表S1）也揭示了由官能团的性质和区域化学决定的变化。这些C60和C60衍生物的这种分子水平可调节的结构，电子和电化学性质预计将显着影响它们在LIB中的性能，如下所述。

### 3.2. Lithium ion storage performance of functionalized C60s
The C60s were used as anode materials and assembled into a coin cell with lithium metal as counter and reference electrodes (see Materials and methods for details). Fig. 3 shows the discharge-charge curves (at current density of 0.1 C) and CVs of four different C60-based LIBs for the initial three cycles. During discharging (intercalation of lithium ions) of pristine C60, the voltage drops reveal several plateaus at 2.0–2.2 V, 1.7–1.9 V, and 1.5–1.7 V in Fig. 3a. The discharge and charge capacities in the first cycle are 653 and 163 mAh g−1, respectively. The CV curve of pristine C60 (Fig. 3b) has three main peaks at 2.05 V, 1.78 V and 1.54 V that matches well with the charge/discharge voltage profiles in Fig. 3a. Ester C60 also shows the first discharging curve with several plateaus at 2.3–2.5 V, 2.1–2.3 V, 1.8–2.0 V, 1.5–1.7 V, 0.7–1.2 V (Fig. 3c) that again correspond well with its CV in Fig. 3d. The initial discharge and charge capacities of ester C60 are 680 mAh g−1 and 401 mAh g−1, respectively, which are larger than those of pristine C60 presumably due to the ester groups on C60. Yet more prominent improvements were observed for carboxyl C60 (Fig. 3e). The discharge and charge capacities of carboxyl C60 for the first cycle are 1373 and 773 mAh g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of pristine C60 and ester C60. Interestingly, unlike the capacity improvements achieved for carboxyl and ester C60s, we observed a relatively low discharge capacity of 335 mAh g−1 and charge capacity of 107 mAh g−1 in the first cycle for piperazine C60 (Fig. 3g), reflecting the counterproductive effect of positively-charged piperazine groups on the capacity performance of C60 in LIBs.  
C60s用作阳极材料，并组装成一个用锂金属作为对电极和参比电极的纽扣电池（有关详细信息，请参阅材料和方法）。图3显示了在最初的三个循环中，四种不同的基于C60的LIB的放电-充电曲线（在0.1 C的电流密度下）和CV。在原始C60放电（插入锂离子）期间，电压降在图3a中的2.0–2.2 V，1.7–1.9 V和1.5–1.7 V处显示出几个平稳状态。在第一循环中的放电和充电容量分别为653和163mAh g-1。原始C60的CV曲线（图3b）在2.05 V，1.78 V和1.54 V处具有三个主峰，与图3a中的充电/放电电压曲线非常吻合。酯C60还显示了第一个放电曲线，在2.3-2.5 V，2.1-2.3 V，1.8-2.0 V，1.5-1.7 V，0.7-1.2 V（图3c）上有几个平稳段，再次与图5中的CV相符。 3d酯C60的初始放电和充电容量分别为680 mAh g-1和401 mAh g-1，据推测比原始C60的大，这是由于C60上的酯基。羧基C60观察到了更显着的改进（图3e）。羧基C60在第一个循环中的放电容量分别为1373和773 mAh g-1，远高于原始C60和酯C60的容量。有趣的是，与羧基和酯C60的容量提高不同，我们在哌嗪C60的第一个循环中观察到相对较低的放电容量335 mAh g-1和充电容量107 mAh g-1（图3g），反映了带正电荷的哌嗪基团对LIBs中C60容量性能的适得其反效果。

Fig. 3. (a), (c), (e), and (g) are discharge-charge profiles at a rate of 0.1 C for the initial three cycles of C60, ester C60, carboxyl C60, and piperazine C60, respectively. (b), (d), (f), and (h) are cyclic voltammograms at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 for the initial three cycles of studied C60 anodes.  
图3.（a），（c），（e）和（g）分别是C60，酯C60，羧基C60和哌嗪C60的前三个循环在0.1 C速率下的放电电荷曲线。 （b），（d），（f）和（h）是在研究的C60阳极的最初三个循环中，扫描速率为0.1 mV s-1的循环伏安图。

Notably, all these C60 and C60 derivatives show large irreversible capacities in the first cycle. For example, the carboxyl C60 has an irreversible capacity loss as high as 600 mAh g−1, which is most likely due to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer [5]. This process corresponds to the voltage plateau at 0.5–0.8 V consistent with the prominent peak in the battery CV (Fig. 3f). The formation of SEI layer is a common issue for most anode materials in LIBs and remains a challenge to be addressed in the future. Nonetheless, the discharging-charging cycles of all the C60s eventually become stable after the 50th cycle (Figs. 3 and 4).  
值得注意的是，所有这些C60和C60衍生物在第一个循环中都显示出不可逆的大容量。例如，羧基C60的不可逆容量损失高达600 mAh g-1，这很可能是由于形成了固体电解质中间相（SEI）层[5]。此过程对应于0.5–0.8 V的电压平稳段，与电池CV中的突出峰值一致（图3f）。对于LIB中大多数阳极材料来说，SEI层的形成是一个普遍的问题，并且仍然是未来需要解决的挑战。尽管如此，所有C60的放电-充电循环最终在第50个循环之后变得稳定（图3和4）。

The cycling performances of four C60s were evaluated at 0.1 C in the voltage range of 0.02–3 V (Fig. 4a). All the C60s exhibit stable and reversible cycling behavior after the first few cycles, as manifested by their negligible capacity losses over 100 charging-discharging cycles. Pristine C60 shows a stabilized charging-discharging capacity of 170 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 3, the discharge capacity of piperazine C60 (83 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle, Fig. 4a) is significantly lower than pristine C60 at all cycle stages. In comparison, carboxyl and ester C60s exhibit a much higher capacity. Specifically, the discharge capacity of carboxyl C60 (ester C60) is 1373 mAh g−1 (680 mAh g−1) in the first cycle, 740 mAh g−1 (336 mAh g−1) in the third cycle, and then gradually increases to and stabilizes at 861 mAh g−1 (404 mAh g−1) after 100 cycles. The increase in capacities after the third cycle is attributed to the activating process of the anode [7]. To the best of our knowledge, these exceptionally high lithium ion storage capacities based on fullerenes materials have never been reported before. In particular, the capacity of carboxyl C60 is five time higher than pristine C60, more than double the capacity of graphite (theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g−1) [14], and higher than graphene (theoretical capacity of 744 mAh g−1) [69]. In Fig. 4a, we also plot the coulombic efficiency of carboxyl C60, which is 56.3% (at 0.1 C) for the first cycle and increases to 92.7% at the third cycle and above 99% after 7 cycles.  
在0.02–3 V的电压范围内，在0.1 C下评估了四台C60的循环性能（图4a）。所有C60在最初的几个循环后都表现出稳定且可逆的循环行为，这可以通过在100个充放电循环中忽略不计的容量损失来证明。原始C60在第100个循环中显示稳定的170 mAh g-1充放电容量。与图3中的观察结果一致，哌嗪C60的放电容量（在第100个循环时为83 mAh g-1，图4a）在所有循环阶段均显着低于原始C60。相比之下，羧基C60和酯C60的容量要高得多。具体地，羧基C60（酯C60）的放电容量在第一循环中为1373mAh g-1（680mAh g-1），在第三循环中为740mAh g-1（336mAh g-1），然后逐渐在100个循环后增加到861 mAh g-1（404 mAh g-1）并稳定下来。第三循环后容量的增加归因于阳极的活化过程[7]。据我们所知，这些基于富勒烯材料的极高的锂离子存储容量从未被报道过。特别是，羧基C60的容量是原始C60的五倍，是石墨的两倍（理论容量为372 mAh g-1）[14]，并且比石墨烯（理论容量为744 mAh g-1）高。 ）[69]。在图4a中，我们还绘制了羧基C60的库伦效率，该值在第一个循环中为56.3％（在0.1 C时），在第三个循环中增加至92.7％，在7个循环后增加至99％以上。

In addition to the high capacity and excellent cycling performance, we also studied the cycling stability of carboxyl C60 at very high charging/discharging rates (Fig. 4b). The cell was first discharged/charged at a current density of 0.1 C for 10 cycles, and then at various current densities from 0.5 to 5 C each for 10 cycles. The discharge capacities are 759, 638, 555, and 461 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 C, respectively. Even at very high rate of 5 C (12 min to full charge), the discharge capacity is still as high as 378 mAh g−1. After cycling at different rates and then returning to 0.1 C, the specific capacity is fully recovered to 773 mAh g−1, showing a very stable cycling performance. In addition, the faster charge and discharge tests with long cycling (1 C for 300 cycles) were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. Notably, the carboxyl-C60-electrode capacity of ca. 560 mAh g−1 was retained after 300 cycles, which corresponds to a 97.7% capacity retention at the rate of 1 C, indicating its extremely stable cycling performance.  
除了高容量和出色的循环性能外，我们还研究了羧基C60在非常高的充电/放电速率下的循环稳定性（图4b）。首先以0.1 C的电流密度将电池放电/充电10个循环，然后以0.5至5 C的各种电流密度放电/充电10个循环。在0.1、0.5、1和2 C下的放电容量分别为759、638、555和461 mAh g-1。即使以非常高的5 C速率（充满电需要12分钟），放电容量仍高达378 mAh g-1。在以不同的速率循环之后，然后返回到0.1 C，比容量被完全恢复到773 mAh g-1，显示出非常稳定的循环性能。此外，还进行了较长循环（1 C，300个循环）的更快的充电和放电测试，结果如图4c所示。值得注意的是，羧基-C60-电极的容量约为。 300次循环后，保留了560 mAh g-1，相当于以1 C的速率保留了97.7％的容量，表明其极其稳定的循环性能。

### 3.3. Mechanisms for the structure-property-performance correlation
Here we propose the mechanisms responsible for the observed dependence of C60 LIB performances on functional groups (Fig. 5). It was reported, through electrochemical studies, that the number of lithium intercalated in one C60 molecule could reach 12, i.e., on average 5 carbon atoms per lithium (LiC5); this number is higher than graphite (LiC6) [58]. Based on this number, the calculated capacity of C60 can be as high as 446 mAh g−1 (see calculation method in Supporting information). This value is, however, much higher than the experimental value of 170 mAh g−1 for pristine C60 (Figs. 3 and 4). The large discrepancy likely results from the highly crystalline nature of C60 with densely pack structure and small specific surface area (1.69 m2 g−1, Table S1 in Supporting information), which limits the diffusion and reversible intercalation of lithium ions in C60.  
在这里，我们提出了负责观察到的C60 LIB性能对官能团依赖性的机制（图5）。据报道，通过电化学研究，在一个C60分子中嵌入的锂数量可达到12个，即每个锂（LiC5）平均5个碳原子；这个数字高于石墨（LiC6）[58]。根据此数字，C60的计算容量可以高达446 mAh g-1（请参阅支持信息中的计算方法）。但是，该值远高于原始C60的170 mAh g-1的实验值（图3和4）。差异很大可能是由于C60具有紧密的堆积结构和较小的比表面积（1.69 m2 g-1，支持信息中的表S1）具有高度结晶性，这限制了锂离子在C60中的扩散和可逆嵌入。

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2211285517305098-gr5.jpg)  
Fig. 5. Schematic mechanism for elucidating the relationship between functionalization and capacity of C60 and its derivatives in LIBs.

By functionalizing C60 with 12 ester groups or 12 carboxyl groups, the reversible capacity of ester C60 and carboxyl C60 can reach 404 mAh g−1 and 861 mAh g−1, respectively. It was suggested that the incorporation of carboxylate and/or ester functional groups in anode materials can improve the LIB capacity due to a high binding energy between O˭C-O functional groups and lithium ions [27], [64]. Taking this factor into consideration and adding up the lithium storage capacities of C60 and carbonyl groups [58], the calculated capacities of ester C60 and carboxyl C60 are ~ 307 mAh g−1 and 483 mAh g−1, respectively. Both are lower than the corresponding experimental values. The higher capacity observed can be rationalized as below. Our recent experimental and theoretical studies on nanographene materials demonstrated that the charge capacity of nanographenes can be increased/decreased by functionalizing the nanographene with electron donating/withdrawing groups, respectively [50]. Electron donating groups increase the electron density on nanographene flakes allowing stabilizing greater number of positively charged lithium ions. Thus, the electron-donating nature of ester groups and carboxylate groups have significantly increased the electron density of the C60 thus allowing complex with greater number of lithium ions, i.e., promoting the intercalation of more lithium ions into the more electron-rich C60 cage. Yet another factor, which contribute to the capacity increase, is the microstructural changes induced by the functional groups, including the less-crystalline structure (larger lattice void space, see Fig. 2) and larger specific surface area (Table S1) of ester and carboxyl C60s than pristine C60. To summarize, the ester and carboxylate groups can bind lithium ions, donate electrons to the C60 cage, and increase the lattice void space and specific surface area for lithium intercalation, all of which result in the high capacity of ester C60 in LIBs.  
通过用12个酯基或12个羧基官能化C60，酯C60和羧基C60的可逆容量分别可以达到404 mAh g-1和861 mAh g-1。有人认为，由于O˭C-O官能团与锂离子之间的结合能高，因此在阳极材料中引入羧酸盐和/或酯官能团可以提高LIB的容量[27]，[64]。考虑到这个因素，加起来C60和羰基的锂存储容量[58]，酯C60和羧基C60的计算容量分别约为307 mAh g-1和483 mAh g-1。两者均低于相应的实验值。观察到的较高容量可以通过以下方式合理化。我们最近对纳米石墨烯材料的实验和理论研究表明，通过分别用供电子/吸电子基团官能化纳米石墨烯，可以增加/降低纳米石墨烯的电荷容量[50]。给电子基团增加了纳米石墨烯薄片上的电子密度，从而可以稳定更多数量的带正电的锂离子。因此，酯基和羧酸酯基的供电子性显着提高了C60的电子密度，从而使络合物具有更多的锂离子，即，促进了更多的锂离子嵌入到更富电子的C60笼中。导致容量增加的另一个因素是官能团引起的微观结构变化，包括酯和酯的结晶度较低的结构（较大的晶格空隙空间，见图2）和较大的比表面积（表S1）。羧基C60比原始C60多。总而言之，酯基和羧酸酯基团可以结合锂离子，向C60笼子提供电子，并增加用于锂嵌入的晶格空隙空间和比表面积，所有这些均导致酯C60在LIB中的高容量。

Although the ester and carboxylate groups behave similarly in terms of inducing electronic and microstructural changes, the experimental capacity of carboxyl C60 (861 mAh g−1) is significantly higher than that of ester C60 (404 mAh g−1), the reason can be attributed to the neutral vs negatively-charged nature of ester and carboxylate groups, respectively. Very important to note that, the carboxylate C60 layer has an overall negative charge which can facilitate the insertion of positively-charged lithium ions through electrostatic attraction. This result is also consistent with the lower capacity of piperazine C60. Indeed, the low capacity of 83 mAh g−1 observed for piperazine C60 is resulting from the electrostatic repulsion force between the positively charged piperazine groups and lithium ions. We note that the electron-withdrawing nature of piperazine groups might be another reason for the low capacity. This comparison suggests that C60s functionalized with carboxyl/carboxylate groups are promising materials for LIB anodes. In summary, our studies provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that the performance of LIB can be optimized through tailored synthesis of C60 with functional group and hierarchical structure that can lead to establishment of structure-property correlation previously not accessible.  
尽管酯基和羧酸酯基团在诱导电子和微观结构变化方面表现相似，但羧基C60（861 mAh g-1）的实验容量明显高于酯C60（404 mAh g-1）的实验容量，原因可能是分别归因于酯基和羧酸酯基团的中性与负电荷性质。非常重要的一点是，羧酸盐C60层总体上带有负电荷，可以促进通过静电吸引插入带正电的锂离子。该结果也与哌嗪C60的较低容量一致。实际上，哌嗪C60的低容量为83 mAh g-1，这是由于带正电的哌嗪基团与锂离子之间的静电排斥力引起的。我们注意到，哌嗪基团的吸电子性质可能是低容量的另一个原因。该比较表明用羧基/羧酸根基团官能化的C60是用于LIB阳极的有前途的材料。总而言之，我们的研究提供了原理证明，即可以通过定制合成具有官能团和层次结构的C60来优化LIB的性能，这些官能团和层次结构可以导致建立以前无法访问的结构-属性相关性。

## 4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated, for the first time, C60 and its derivatives with well-defined molecular structures as anode materials in LIBs. Four different C60s including pristine, ester, carboxyl, and piperazine C60, were thoroughly characterized by NMR, TEM, UV–visible spectroscopy, and XRD in terms of their structure and morphology. Then the relationship between the molecular structures and lithium ion storage properties was established to provide guidance to rational design of organic compound-based electrodes for LIBs. The carboxyl C60 based LIBs showed the highest charge capacity of 861 mAh g−1 after 100 charging-discharging cycles with nearly 100% columbic efficiency. This is significantly higher than those of pristine C60 (170 mAh g−1), ester C60 (404 mAh g−1), and piperazine C60 (83 mAh g−1), and is also superior than commercial graphite (theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g−1) and graphene (theoretical capacity of 744 mAh g−1). We discovered that C60 derivatives can be a highly efficient LIB anode material. The results strongly suggest that superior exceptional performance of carboxyl C60 links to a combination of several structural parameters. They include a complex formation between lithium ions and oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group i.e., strong Li binding sites provided by O˭C-O. The improved lithium-binding capability of C60 cage is also due to increased electron density resulting from electron donating nature of carboxylate groups. Furthermore, the electrostatic attraction between carboxylate groups and lithium ions, the large lattice void space, and high specific area have all contributed to the excellent LIB properties. Most importantly, the structure-property-performance relationship established in this work suggests that C60 derivatives are very promising anode materials through a functionalization with desired substituents. Accurate controls of molecular structure, surface charge, crystalline packing, specific surface area, and electrochemical property impact the performance of lithium-ion storage. This work offers new insights and directions that tailoring synthesis of C60 derivatives or any other organic compounds with optimal functional groups can lead to new types of highly efficient carbon-based materials for energy storage.  
总而言之，我们首次证明了具有明确分子结构的C60及其衍生物可作为LIB的阳极材料。 NMR，TEM，UV可见光谱和XRD对四种不同的C60（包括原始C60，酯，羧基和哌嗪C60）进行了彻底的结构和形态表征。然后建立了分子结构与锂离子存储性能之间的关系，为锂离子电池有机化合物基电极的合理设计提供指导。基于羧基C60的LIB在100次充放电循环后显示出最高的充电容量861 mAh g-1，具有近100％的哥伦比亚效率。这显着高于原始C60（170 mAh g-1），酯C60（404 mAh g-1）和哌嗪C60（83 mAh g-1）的性能，也优于市售石墨（理论容量为372） mAh g-1）和石墨烯（理论容量744 mAh g-1）。我们发现C60衍生物可以是一种高效的LIB阳极材料。结果强烈表明，羧基C60的优异性能与多种结构参数的组合有关。它们包括在锂离子和羧基上的氧原子之间的络合物形成，即由O˭C-O提供的强Li结合位点。 C60笼的锂结合能力的提高还归因于羧酸根基团的供电子性所带来的电子密度的提高。此外，羧酸根基团和锂离子之间的静电引力，大的晶格空隙空间和高的比表面积均有助于优异的LIB性能。最重要的是，这项工作中建立的结构-性能-性能关系表明，C60衍生物通过具有所需取代基的官能化作用，是非常有前途的阳极材料。精确控制分子结构，表面电荷，晶体堆积，比表面积和电化学性质会影响锂离子存储的性能。这项工作提供了新的见解和方向，可以定制具有最佳官能团的C60衍生物或任何其他有机化合物的合成，从而可以开发出新型的高效碳基材料用于储能。
