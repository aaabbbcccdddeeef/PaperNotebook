## Abstract
We demonstrate herein the use of a one-dimensional metal–organic material as a new type of electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in place of the classic porous three-dimensional materials, which are subject to the size of the channel for lithium-ion diffusion and blocking of the windows of the framework by organic solvents during the charging and discharging processes. Introducing a one-dimensional coordination compound can keep organic active substances insoluble in the electrolyte during the charging and discharging processes, providing a facile and general new system for further studies. The results show that both the aromatic ligand and the metal center can participate in lithium storage simultaneously, illustrating a new energy storage mechanism that has been well-characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the fact that the one-dimensional chains are linked by weak hydrogen bonds rather than strong π–π stacking interactions or covalent bonds is beneficial for the release of capacity entirely without the negative effect of burying the active sites.

## Introduction
Electrical energy storage materials are promising substitutes for traditional fossil fuels because of their renewability, low environmental impact, and low cost.(1-3) Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are among the most important energy storage materials considering their cost-effective, highly efficient, and environmentally friendly energy storage characteristics. However, poor rate capabilities, relatively low practical capacities, and Li-plating issues still limit their applications.(4-6) Moreover, high energy consumption for the synthesis of electrode materials prevents their practical applications despite their excellent electrochemical performance. Hence, the development of new types of electrode materials for LIBs remains a great challenge for both chemists and materials scientists.  
电能存储材料具有可再生性，低环境影响和低成本等优点，有望成为传统化石燃料的替代品。（1-3）锂离子电池（LIB）考虑到它们的成本效益，是最重要的储能材料之一，高效，环保的储能特性。但是，差的速率能力，相对较低的实际容量以及镀锂问题仍然限制了它们的应用。（4-6）此外，尽管电极材料具有出色的电化学性能，但合成电极材料的高能耗却阻止了它们的实际应用。因此，对于LIBs新型电极材料的开发对于化学家和材料科学家而言仍然是一个巨大的挑战。

Coordination compounds are a family of compounds containing coordination bonds, which are generally formed between a metal center and a donor atom of an inorganic/organic ligand.(7) A variety of practical applications for coordination compounds, such as in catalytic chemistry,(8, 9) biochemistry,(10-12) and porous materials,(13) have been developed since Alfred Werner won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1913. In principle, coordination compounds are promising candidates as electrode materials with the following advantages: (i) the redox-active metal center can accommodate multiple electrons;(14, 15) (ii) the structural diversity and flexibility of the ligands can be controlled at the molecular level, allowing the ligands to be redox-active, to be processed efficiently, and to be prepared from renewable resources;(16-21) (iii) enhanced electrochemical performance can be achieved by the combination of redox-active metal centers and organic ligands; and (iv) the synthesis of coordination compounds requires relatively low energy consumption. However, regardless of their solubility in a given electrolyte, the charge and discharge processes may cause the decomposition of coordination compounds used as electrodes, which limits the practical applications of these materials. To date, the coordination compounds studied in the context of LIBs are simply based on redox-active metal ions or functional organic groups.(22-25) To solve this problem, one promising strategy is to link the metal center with a redox-active bridging/chelating ligand to form a one-dimensional (1D) chain or a high-dimensional framework, benefiting both the electrochemical and solid-state stability and reversibility.  
配位化合物是一类包含配位键的化合物，通常在金属中心与无机/有机配体的供体原子之间形成。（7）配位化合物在各种实际应用中，例如催化化学中，（8） ，9）自1913年阿尔弗雷德·沃纳（Alfred Werner）获得诺贝尔化学奖以来，已经开发出了生物化学（10-12）和多孔材料（13）。原则上，配位化合物有望成为具有以下优点的电极材料：（i ）氧化还原活性金属中心可以容纳多个电子;（14，15）（ii）可以在分子水平上控制配体的结构多样性和柔韧性，使配体具有氧化还原活性，可以有效地进行处理; （16-21）（iii）氧化还原活性金属中心和有机配体的结合可以提高电化学性能； （iv）配位化合物的合成需要相对较低的能量消耗。然而，不管它们在给定的电解质中的溶解性如何，充电和放电过程都可能导致用作电极的配位化合物分解，这限制了这些材料的实际应用。迄今为止，在LIBs中研究的配位化合物仅基于氧化还原活性金属离子或功能性有机基团。（22-25）为解决此问题，一种有前途的策略是将金属中心与氧化还原活性连接桥接/螯合配体以形成一维（1D）链或高维骨架，有利于电化学和固态稳定性以及可逆性。

As a continuation of previous research on coordination chemistry using pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid and its derivatives,(26-29) we selected [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n (H3L = 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) as an advanced anode active material for LIBs. The results of the present study reveal that both the aromatic chelating ligand and the metal centers participate in lithium storage, suggesting a new energy storage mechanism for coordination compounds. More importantly, this work represents the first example of a 1D coordination compound as an active energy storage substance instead of using traditional porous three-dimensional materials, which depend on the size of the channel for lithium-ion diffusion and obstruction of the pore window via organic solvents during the charging and discharging processes. In addition, the 1D chains are linked by weak hydrogen bonds rather than by strong π–π stacking interactions or covalent bonds, allowing the materials to approach their maximum potential capacity without the negative effect of burying active redox sites.  
作为以前使用吡啶-2,6-二羧酸及其衍生物进行配位化学研究的延续，（26-29）我们选择了[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n（H3L = 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-二羧酸）作为LIB的高级阳极活性材料。本研究的结果表明，**芳族螯合配体和金属中心均参与锂的存储，为配位化合物提供了新的能量存储机制**。更重要的是，这项工作代表了一维配位化合物作为活性能量存储物质的第一个示例，而不是使用传统的多孔三维材料，这取决于锂离子扩散通道的尺寸和孔窗口的阻塞。充放电过程中的有机溶剂。另外，一维链通过弱氢键而不是通过强π-π堆积相互作用或共价键连接，从而使材料能够达到其最大潜在容量，而不会掩埋活性氧化还原位。

All of the reagents were purchased commercially and used as received. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement of [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n was recorded on an Oxford Supernova diffractometer using graphite-monochromatized Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed on a PerkinElmer 2400-II CHNS/O analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under an atmosphere of N2 on a Labsys NETZSCH TG 209 Setaram apparatus at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 from 25 to 800 °C. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV instrument equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å); the samples were scanned at 10° min–1 in the 2θ range from 3 to 50°. Direct-current (dc) magnetic susceptibilities were measured on a Quantum Design VSM SQUID magnetometer. Electrochemical characterizations were conducted using a two-electrode coin-cell configuration (CR2032). The charge–discharge curves were collected on a LAND battery testing system at room temperature (298 K). Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a PARSTAT 4000 electrochemical workstation.

Battery performance tests were performed using a CR2032 coin-cell battery setup. The anode containing a 60 wt % loading of the coordination compound was prepared according to the following procedure: 60 mg of as-prepared [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n was ground into powder with a mortar and pestle, and 30 mg of Super P and 10 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride were subsequently added to the mortar. The mixture was ground again with a pestle for 30 min. Next, 0.5 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added to the mixture to form a paste, which was subsequently coated onto copper foil and dried at 100 °C overnight. The cathode and anode were separated with a polypropylene film, and the electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate. The battery was assembled in an argon-filled glovebox.

## Results and Discussion
Red block-shaped crystals of [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n (Figure 1) were synthesized from the reaction of Co(OH)2 and H3L.(29) As shown in Figure 1a, two Co2+ ions are chelated and bridged by two L3– ligands to form a binuclear [Co2L2] grid, and these grids are further connected by one additional Co2+ ion through the oxygen at the 4-position of L3– to form a zigzag chain. The 3D structure is sustained by extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions through the chains (Figure 1b). The hydrogen-bonding parameters are shown in Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

The PXRD patterns of the as-synthesized [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n are in good agreement with the patterns simulated from the single-crystal data (Figure S2), indicating high phase purity of the material. The application of [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n as the anode material in LIBs features an outstanding charge–discharge efficiency and excellent capacity retention. It delivers a reversible capacity of 431 mAh g–1 at a current density of 50 mA g–1 (the theoretical capacity of [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n is 472 mAh g–1; see below), which is greater than the theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mAh g–1),(30) as shown in Figure 2a,b. The irreversible discharge capacity loss from 1978 mAh g–1 for the first cycle to 869 mAh g–1 for the second cycle is a result of the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the interfacial lithium storage caused by the decomposition of the electrolyte.(31, 32) The discharge capacity decreased from 869 to 431 mAh g–1 from the second cycle to the 10th cycle because water within the binder reacted with lithium to form Li2O inside the interlayers or on the surface.(33, 34) We also attempted to use anhydrous [Co1.5L]n for LIB studies; however, this material is not stable because of the removal of the water molecules, which leads to a much lower specific capacity (Figures S3 and S4). Actually, water molecules in the 3D supramolecular structure form hydrogen bonds, which reduce the activation energy for lithium-ion insertion and prevent organic solvent coinsertion.(35, 36) With respect to the cycle-life performance, the Coulombic efficiency appears to level off almost immediately and then remains constant at 98.3%, indicating that the SEI layer formed in the first cycle is fairly stable. To further examine the cycling stability and rate capacity, discharge and charge cycles were conducted at various current densities (Figure 2c). The discharge capacities were 392, 270, 155, and 85 mAh g–1 at rates of 50, 100, and 200 and 500 mA g–1, respectively. After enduring various charge–discharge rates, the electrode recovered its capacity of 383 mAh g–1 when the rate was returned to 50 mA g–1 and maintained this value without any apparent decay.  
合成后的[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n的PXRD图谱与从单晶数据模拟得到的图谱非常吻合（图S2），表明该材料具有较高的相纯度。 [Co1.5L（H2O）4] n作为LIB的负极材料的应用具有出色的充放电效率和出色的容量保持能力。它在50 mA g–1的电流密度下可提供431 mAh g–1的可逆容量（[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n的理论容量为472 mAh g–1；请参见下文），该值更大比石墨的理论容量（372 mAh g–1），（30）大，如图2a，b所示。从第一个循环的1978 mAh g–1到第二个循环的869 mAh g–1不可逆的放电容量损失是由于固体电解质中间相（SEI）的形成和界面锂存储的结果，其中（31，32）从第二个循环到第10个循环，放电容量从869 mAh g-1下降到431 mAh g-1，这是因为粘合剂中的水与锂反应而在中间层内部或表面形成Li2O。（33，34）我们还尝试使用无水[Co1.5L] n进行LIB研究；但是，由于去除了水分子，该材料不稳定，导致比容量低得多（图S3和S4）。实际上，**3D超分子结构中的水分子形成氢键，从而降低了插入锂离子的活化能并防止了有机溶剂的共聚**。（35，36）就循环寿命性能而言，库仑效率似乎趋于平稳。几乎立即，然后保持恒定在98.3％，这表明在第一个循环中形成的SEI层相当稳定。为了进一步检查循环稳定性和倍率容量，在各种电流密度下进行了放电和充电循环（图2c）。放电容量分别为50、100、200和500 mA g-1时，分别为392、270、155和85 mAh g-1。在经历了各种充放电速率后，当该速率恢复到50 mA g-1时，电极恢复了383 mAh g-1的容量，并保持了该值而没有任何明显的衰减。

To study the electrochemical redox reaction mechanism, cyclic voltammetry was conducted first. Figure 2d shows the cyclic voltammograms between 3.0 and 0.01 V vs Li+/Li. The reduction peak at 1.16 V is assigned to the insertion reaction of the Li+ ions into Co3L2(H2O)8 to form Li6Co3L2(H2O)8, and the oxidation peak emerging at 1.29 V corresponds to the extraction reaction of the Li+ ions from Li6Co3L2(H2O)8 to form Co3L2(H2O)8. The redox reaction of Co3L2(H2O)8 at an average potential of 1.22 V proceeds smoothly between Co2+ and Co0 (Co3L2(H2O)8/Li6Co3L2(H2O)8) (Scheme 1).(37) The decrease in the electrode potential of Co2+/Co0 caused by the ligand field suggests that [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n is more favorable as an anode material.(38) The second reduction peak at 0.45 V is assigned to the insertion reaction of Li+ ions into Li6Co3L2(H2O)8 to form Li12Co3L2(H2O)8. The oxidation peak emerging at 1.0 V corresponds to the extraction reaction of the Li+ ions from Li12Co3L2(H2O)8 to form Li6Co3L2(H2O)8. As shown in Scheme 1, the redox reaction of Li6Co3L2(H2O)8 at an average potential of 0.8 V proceeds between carboxylate carbonyl and enolate groups, accompanied by insertion/extraction of Li+ ions into/from Li6Co3L2(H2O)8/Li12Co3L2(H2O)8.(39)  
为了研究电化学氧化还原反应机理，首先进行了循环伏安法。图2d显示了相对于Li + /Li在3.0至0.01 V之间的循环伏安图。在1.16 V处的还原峰归属于Li +离子向Co3L2（H2O）8的插入反应以形成Li6Co3L2（H2O）8，而在1.29 V处出现的氧化峰对应于Li +离子从Li6Co3L2（ H 2 O）8形成Co 3 L 2（H 2 O）8。 Co3L2（H2O）8的平均电势为1.22 V的氧化还原反应在Co2 +和Co0（Co3L2（H2O）8 /Li6Co3L2（H2O）8）之间平稳进行（方案1）。（37）电极电势的降低配体场引起的Co2+/Co0表明[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n更适合作为负极材料。（38）在0.45 V处的第二个还原峰归因于Li +离子向Li6Co3L2的插入反应（ H 2 O）8形成Li 12 Co 3 L 2（H 2 O）8。 1.0 V处出现的氧化峰对应于Li +离子从Li12Co3L2（H2O）8的萃取反应，形成Li6Co3L2（H2O）8。如方案1所示，Li6Co3L2（H2O）8的平均电势为0.8 V时，在羰基羧酸盐和烯醇盐基团之间进行氧化还原反应，伴随着Li +离子与Li6Co3L2（H2O）8 /Li12Co3L2（H2O）的插入/分离。 ）8.（39）

The aforementioned mechanism suggests that the oxidation state of cobalt could be changed during the charge–discharge process, which can be determined by Co 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 3a, the peaks at 776.6 and 791.7 eV are assigned to the characteristic peaks of Co2+.(40) After the discharge process (Figure 3b), the Co 2p peaks shift to 778.3 and 793.7 eV, indicating the formation of Co0.(41) The Co 2p spectrum after the charge process is consistent with the Co 2p spectrum of the original [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n sample. The XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s were further studied (Figure S5). In the C 1s XPS spectra, the energies of 284.8, 288.6, and 290.6 eV are assigned to the characteristic peaks of the carbon–carbon double bond of the pyridine ring, the carboxyl, and the carbon–carbon single bond of the enol structure, respectively.(42) According to the spectra, the carboxyl of L3– transformed into the enol structure after the discharge process and appeared again after the charge process, suggesting a reversible interconversion between the carboxyl and enol structures. In the O 1s spectra, the two peaks at 531.6 and 529.3 eV are assigned to the lattice oxygen and the Li–O bond, respectively.(43) These results suggest that the Li–O bond formed after gaining electrons and disappeared after losing electrons, further indicating the reversibility of the redox reaction. In the discharge process, the carboxylic oxygen acquires an electron, which leads to the formation of a carbon–carbon double bond. The electron on the pyridine ring results in the formation of a carbon free radical. Because of the conjugation effect from the aromatic ring and the enol structure, the carbon free radical is fairly stable. As shown in Figure 4a, an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement showed the existence of a carbon free radical on the pyridine ring of the electrode material after the first discharge process, with a g value of 2.0064; this result further confirms the aforementioned mechanism.  
前述机理表明，钴的氧化态可以在充放电过程中改变，这可以通过Co 2p X射线光电子能谱（XPS）来确定。如图3a所示，在776.6和791.7 eV处的峰被分配给Co2+的特征峰。（40）在放电过程（图3b）之后，Co 2p峰移至778.3和793.7 eV，表明形成了Co0 。（41）充电过程后的Co 2p光谱与原始[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n样品的Co 2p光谱一致。进一步研究了C 1s和O 1s的XPS光谱（图S5）。在C 1s XPS光谱中，284.8 eV，288.6 eV和290.6 eV的能量分配给吡啶环的碳-碳双键，羧基和烯醇结构的碳-碳单键的特征峰，（42）根据光谱，L3–的羧基在放电过程后转变为烯醇结构，并在充电过程后再次出现，表明羧基和烯醇结构之间可逆相互转化。在O 1s光谱中，在531.6和529.3 eV处的两个峰分别分配给晶格氧和Li–O键。（43）这些结果表明，Li–O键在获得电子后形成，在失去电子后消失。进一步表明了氧化还原反应的可逆性。在放电过程中，羧酸氧获取电子，这导致形成碳-碳双键。吡啶环上的电子导致碳自由基的形成。由于芳环和烯醇结构的共轭作用，碳自由基相当稳定。如图4a所示，电子顺磁共振（EPR）测量表明，在第一次放电过程之后，电极材料的吡啶环上存在碳自由基，其g值为2.0064；该结果进一步证实了前述机制。

Stability is an important feature of coordination compounds as electrode materials during the charge and discharge processes. In our case, [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n exhibits specific structural features and excellent stability. First, the chelation of L3– to Co2 results in a relatively stable structure; second, according to crystal-field theory, Co1 (D4h coordination symmetry) and Co2 (D3h coordination symmetry) both have crystal-field stabilization energy before and after the charge and discharge processes, which is beneficial to both stability and reversibility. The magnetic measurement gave a χMT value of 5.12 cm3 mol–1 K at 300 K, which is larger than the spin-only value of 2.82 cm3 mol–1 K for 1.5 free CoII ions as a consequence of the orbital contribution (Figure 4b). The magnetic result is consistent with the energy splitting diagrams in Figure 4c.  
在充电和放电过程中，稳定性是配位化合物作为电极材料的重要特征。在我们的案例中，[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n表现出特定的结构特征和出色的稳定性。首先，L3–与CO2的螯合导致结构相对稳定。其次，根据晶体场理论，Co1（D4h配位对称性）和Co2（D3h配位对称性）在充放电前后均具有晶场稳定能，这有利于稳定性和可逆性。磁测量在300 K时的χMT值为5.12 cm3 mol–1 K，由于轨道贡献的结果，它对1.5个游离CoII离子的自旋值为2.82 cm3 mol–1 K较大（图4b） 。磁性结果与图4c中的能量分裂图一致。

Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a new generation of porous crystalline materials constructed via coordination bonds between inorganic nodes and organic linkers, have attracted great attention as electrode materials.(22-25, 44, 45) For example, FeIII(OH)0.8F0.2(BDC)·H2O (MIL-53(Fe)) was studied as a cathode and exhibited a reversible capacity of 75 mAh g–1. Its relatively low energy density is a consequence of its poor electronic conductivity.(44) MOF-177 (Zn4O(BTB)2, BTB3– = 1,3,5-benzenetribenzoate), with a very high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 5250 m2 g–1, was studied for lithium storage as an anode material; however, structural destruction after lithium storage was observed.(45) As an alternative, the 1D metal–organic material [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n exhibited a reversible capacity of 431 mAh g–1 when used as an anode material for LIBs; this capacity is much higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mAh g–1). Such 1D metal–organic materials benefit from the following two structural features: (i) dual redox-active metal centers and organic components are coordinated together for enhanced insolubility and stability in the electrolyte, and (ii) the coordination chains are weakly connected via hydrogen bonds, which provide channels for lithium-ion diffusion.  
最近，通过无机节点和有机连接基之间的配位键构建的新一代多孔晶体材料金属有机骨架（MOFs）作为电极材料备受关注。（22-25，44，45）例如，FeIII（ OH）0.8F0.2（BDC）·H2O（MIL-53（Fe））作为阴极进行了研究，其可逆容量为75 mAh g-1。其相对较低的能量密度是其较差的电子电导率的结果。（44）MOF-177（Zn4O（BTB）2，BTB3– = 1,3,5-苯三苯甲酸酯），Brunauer–Emmett–Teller（BET）非常高）研究了5250 m2 g-1的表面积作为阳极材料用于锂存储；然而，观察到锂储存后结构破坏。（45）作为替代，一维金属有机材料[Co1.5L（H2O）4] n在用作阳极材料时可逆容量为431 mAh g–1。 LIB；该容量远高于石墨的理论容量（372 mAh g–1）。**这种一维金属有机材料受益于以下两个结构特征：（i）双重氧化还原活性金属中心和有机成分相互配合以增强电解质的不溶性和稳定性，并且（ii）配位链通过氢弱连接键，为锂离子扩散提供通道**。

## Conclusions
We introduced a 1D metal–organic material as a new anode active material for LIBs. The coordination between the metal ion and the bridging ligand forming the chain structure not only enhances the solid-state stability for LIBs but also provides a means of combining two active elements for enhanced electrochemical performance. The independent redox-active sites on both the metal and ligand simultaneously contribute to the capacity, resulting in a stable capacity and a Coulombic efficiency of 98.3%. The newly discovered mechanism, in which both cobalt ions and ligands are involved in the redox reaction, was revealed via the Co 2p, C 1s, and O 1s XPS spectra, EPR spectra, and cyclic voltammograms, which are consistent with the observed electrochemical performance. Moreover, the introduction of a coordination chain compound does not have restrictions for the size of the channels of the electrode materials for lithium-ion diffusion and prevents the solubility of active organic substances in the electrolyte during the charging and discharging processes. This result provides a new approach to use coordination compounds as electrode materials for rechargeable LIBs. Continuations of the research using 1D/2D metal–organic materials with both a redox-active metal ion and a ligand are underway in our lab.  
我们引入了一维金属有机材料作为LIB的新阳极活性材料。金属离子和形成链结构的桥连配体之间的配位不仅增强了LIB的固态稳定性，而且还提供了将两种活性元素结合以增强电化学性能的手段。金属和配体上的独立氧化还原活性位点同时提高了容量，从而产生了稳定的容量和98.3％的库仑效率。通过Co 2p，C 1s和O 1s XPS光谱，EPR光谱和循环伏安图揭示了新发现的机理，其中钴离子和配体都参与了氧化还原反应，这与观察到的电化学性能一致。此外，配位链化合物的引入对用于锂离子扩散的电极材料的通道的尺寸没有限制，并且防止了在充电和放电过程中活性有机物质在电解质中的溶解性。该结果提供了使用配位化合物作为可再充电锂离子电池的电极材料的新方法。我们的实验室正在继续使用具有氧化还原活性金属离子和配体的1D /2D金属有机材料。
