## Abstract
Organic Na-host materials have are now actively pursued as an attractive alternative to conventional transition-metal compounds for development of sustainable sodium ion batteries; however, most of the organic compounds reported so far suffer from their low reversible capacity and poor cyclability. Here, we report a simple perylene diimide, 3,4,9,10-perylene-bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI), which demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performances as an organic cathode for Na-ion batteries. With the high density of redox-active carbonyl groups in a stable π-conjugated structure, the PTCDI molecule can undergo a two-electron redox reaction with reversible insertion/extraction of 2 Na+ ions per molecular unit, demonstrating a high capacity of 140 mAh g–1, a strong rate performance with a reversible capacity of 103 mAh g–1 at 600 mA g–1 (5 C,1 C = 120 mA g–1) and a long-term cyclability with 90% capacity retention over 300 cycles. Because this PTCDI material is commercially available and nontoxic, it may serve as a new alternative cathode for Na-ion battery applications.  
现在，有机钠基质材料已被积极地寻求作为常规过渡金属化合物的有吸引力的替代品，以开发可持续的钠离子电池。然而，迄今为止报道的大多数有机化合物都具有可逆容量低和可循环性差的缺点。在这里，我们报告一个简单的per二酰亚胺3,4,9,10-per-双（二甲叉酰亚胺）（PTCDI），它作为Na-离子电池的有机阴极表现出显着的电化学性能。凭借稳定的π共轭结构中高密度的氧化还原活性羰基，PTCDI分子可以进行两电子氧化还原反应，每个分子单元可逆地插入/抽出2Na+离子，显示出140 mAh g的高容量–1，强大的速率性能，在600 mA g–1（5 C，1 C = 120 mA g–1）时可逆容量为103 mAh g–1，长期可循环性，在300次循环中保持90％的容量。由于这种PTCDI材料是可商购的且无毒，因此可以用作Na离子电池应用的新替代阴极。

## Introduction
Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have recently aroused considerable interest as a low cost alternative to Li-ion batteries for electric energy storage applications because of the natural abundance of sodium resources and the similar intercalation chemistry of sodium ions with lithium ions.(1-3) Though a large variety of Na-insertion compounds with acceptable electrochemical performances have been reported as possible cathode-active materials for SIBs, they are mostly based on transition-metal compounds,(4, 5) which will still impose cost and resource restraints for large scale applications. Therefore, development of low cost and “rare metal-free” electrodes is of practical importance to promote Na-ion batteries for widespread electric storage applications.
In recent development of organic materials for Na-ion batteries, a variety of redox-active polymers have been reexamined as Na cathode hosts due to their flexible frameworks and tunable redox potentials.(6) Though a few of p-doped polymers(7-10) and radical polymers(11) demonstrated a high potential and redox activitiy in Na-ion battery electrolytes, their charge/discharge reactions took place through a reversible p-doping/dedoping mechanism of electrolyte anions, which cannot act as a Na+ host for Na-ion batteries. Recently, a number of self-doped polymers with ionizable sodium sulfonate(12, 13) and tailored aromatic polyimides with Na+-associable carbonyl groups(14, 15) were found to reversibly accommodate Na+ ions as organic cathodes; however, their Na-storage capacities are not sufficiently high due to their low densities of active sites for the electrochemical sodiation reaction in the large polymeric backbones.  
在用于Na离子电池的有机材料的最新发展中，由于其具有灵活的框架和可调节的氧化还原电位，**已将多种氧化还原活性聚合物作为Na阴极主体进行了重新研究。（6）尽管有少数p掺杂聚合物（7-10）和自由基聚合物（11）在Na离子电池电解质中表现出高电势和氧化还原活性**，它们的充电/放电反应是通过电解质阴离子的可逆p掺杂/去掺杂机理发生的，而该机理不能作为Na+主体钠离子电池。最近，发现许多具有离子化磺酸钠的自掺杂聚合物（12、13）和具有与Na+结合的羰基的量身定制的芳族聚酰亚胺（14、15）可逆地容纳Na+离子作为有机阴极。然而，由于它们在大型聚合物主链中用于电化学加成反应的活性位点密度低，因此它们的钠存储能力不够高。

In principle, many small organic molecules with carbonyl groups, such as quinones, anhydrides, imides, and ketones, can undergo electrochemical redox reactions through reversible uptake and release of alkali ions at considerably high potentials, possibly serving as high capacity organic cathodes for battery applications. However, these organic compounds are mostly investigated as Li- storage cathodes(16-19) but have been less examined in Na+ electrolytes. Recently, Yao et al. reported a 5,5′-indigodisulfonic acid sodium salt with a discharge capacity of ∼90 mA g–1 at 1.8 V (vs Na+/Na) and a stable cyclability in Na+ electrolyte.(20) Similar Na-storage behaviors were also observed for disodium pyromellitic diimidate.(21) Particularly, Luo et al. reported a commercially available organic pigment, 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylicacid-dianhydride, as Na-ion battery cathode, which demonstrated a high capacity of 145 mAh g–1, high rate capability up to 1000 mA g–1, and stable cycling performance over 200 cycles.(22) Nevertheless, these pioneering works have revealed the feasibility to build high-capacity and cycle-stable Na-storage cathodes using small organic molecules.  
原则上，许多具有羰基的有机小分子，例如醌，酸酐，酰亚胺和酮，可以通过在相当高的电势下可逆地吸收和释放碱离子而发生电化学氧化还原反应，可能用作电池应用的高容量有机阴极。然而，这些有机化合物大多被研究为锂存储阴极（16-19），但在Na+电解质中的研究较少。最近，姚等人。报道了一种5,5'-靛二磺酸钠盐，在1.8 V（vs Na+ /Na）下的放电容量为〜90 mA g-1，并且在Na+电解质中具有稳定的循环性。（20）还观察到类似的Na储存行为（21）特别是，Luo等人。报道了一种市售有机颜料3,4,9,10-per-四羧酸二酐，作为Na离子电池阴极，具有145 mAh g-1的高容量，高达1000 mA g-1的高倍率容量，并且在200个循环中具有稳定的循环性能。（22）然而，这些开创性工作揭示了使用小有机分子构建高容量且循环稳定的Na存储阴极的可行性。

In the search for better organic cathodes for Na-ion batteries, we focused our attention on perylene diimide compounds because of their insolubility in organic electrolytes and multiple Na+-bonding sites per molecular unit, which are critical for an organic cathode to achieve a long cycle life and high Na-storage capacity. Among the perylene diimide derivatives tested, a structurally simplest 3,4,9,10-Perylene-bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 140 mAh g–1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 90% over 300 cycles. Particularly, this molecule is commercial available and nontoxic, possibly fulfilling the needs for large-scale battery applications. Here, we report the electrochemical behavior of PTCDI as an organic cathode and describe its Na-storage mechanism in organic electrolyte.  
在寻找更好的Na离子电池有机阴极时，我们将注意力集中在per二酰亚胺化合物上，因为它们在有机电解质中不溶并且每个分子单元具有多个Na+键位，这对于有机阴极实现长周期至关重要寿命和高的Na存储容量。在所测试的di二酰亚胺衍生物中，结构最简单的3,4,9,10-Per-双（二甲叉酰亚胺）（PTCDI）表现出140 mAh g-1的高可逆容量，在300次循环中具有90％的显着容量保持率。特别地，该分子是可商购的并且是无毒的，可能满足大规模电池应用的需求。在这里，我们报告PTCDI作为有机阴极的电化学行为，并描述其在有机电解质中的Na储存机理。

## Experimental Section
The PTCDI sample used in this was commercially available product (97% purity), purchased from Chushenwei Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Hubei, China, and used without further purification. The organic cathode was prepared by mixing 70% PTCDI powders, 20% Super P carbon and 10% polytetrafluoroethylene binder into an electrode paste, then rolling the paste into a thin film of ∼100 μm thickness and finally pressing the electrode film onto an aluminum mesh. The electrochemical performances of the PTCDI cathode were evaluated by 2016 type coin cells using a Na disk as anode, a porous polypropylene separator (Celgard No. 2400, Celgard, Inc.) as separator and 1.0 mol L–1 NaPF6 in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), diethylcarbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (EC/DEC/PC, 45:45:10 vol %) as electrolyte. Each cathode contained approximately 3 mg active PTCDI powers. All the coin cells were assembled in a glovebox with water/oxygen content lower than 1 ppm and tested at room temperature. The galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were conducted on a LAND cycler (Wuhan Kingnuo Electronic Co. China). Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s–1 on a CHI 660a electrochemical workstation (Chen Hua Instruments Co., China).  
该样品中使用的PTCDI样品为市售产品（纯度为97％），购自中国湖北楚神威化工有限公司，未经进一步纯化即可使用。**通过将70％PTCDI粉末，20％Super P碳和10％聚四氟乙烯粘合剂混合到电极浆料中，然后将浆料辊压成厚度约为100μm的薄膜，最后将电极膜压到铝网上，制备有机阴极**。 PTCDI阴极的电化学性能通过使用Na盘作为阳极，多孔聚丙烯隔膜（Celgard No.2400，Celgard，Inc.）作为隔膜和1.0 mol L–1 NaPF6在混合溶剂中的2016型纽扣电池进行了评估。作为电解质的碳酸亚乙酯（EC），碳酸二乙酯（EC）和碳酸亚丙酯（PC）（EC /DEC /PC，45：45：10 vol％）。每个阴极均包含约3 mg有源PTCDI电源。将所有币形电池组装在水/氧含量低于1 ppm的手套箱中，并在室温下进行测试。恒电流放电/充电测试是在LAND循环仪（武汉金诺电子有限公司，中国）上进行的。循环伏安法测量是在CHI 660a电化学工作站（中国辰华仪器有限公司）上以1 mV s–1的扫描速率进行的。

The morphologies of the PTCDI material were observed by using SEM (Sirion, 2000, FEI) and TEM (JEM-2010FEF). The FTIR spectrum was recorded using KBr pellets on AVATAR 360 spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Corp., Madison, WI) in wavelength range of 400–4000 cm–1. The lattice structure of the PTCDI crystal was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction in the 2θ range of 5–80° at a scan rate of 4° min–1 on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα. XRD peaks of PTCDI was analyzed using Jade 6.5 software. For these ex situ spectroscopic characterizations, the test cells were disassembled in Ar-filled glovebox (O2 and H2O concentration <1.0 ppm) and the cathode samples were peeled off from the current collector, repeatedly rinsed with pure DEC solvent and then vacuum-dried at 100 °C for 40 min. The prepared cathode samples were immediately sent for XRD measurements. The schematic diagram of the molecular arrangement in PTCDI crystal was analyzed using the Materials module within Mercury CSD 2.0.(23)  
通过使用SEM（Sirion，2000，FEI）和TEM（JEM-2010FEF）观察到PTCDI材料的形貌。 FTIR光谱是使用KBr颗粒在AVATAR 360光谱仪（威斯康星州麦迪逊市尼科莱特仪器公司）上记录的，波长范围为400-4000 cm-1。 PTCDI晶体的晶格结构在Shimadzu XRD-6000衍射仪上用CuKα在5–80°的2θ范围内以4°min-1的扫描速率通过粉末X射线衍射分析。使用Jade 6.5软件分析PTCDI的XRD峰。对于这些异地光谱表征，将测试电池在充满Ar的手套箱中进行分解（O2和H2O浓度<1.0 ppm），然后将阴极样品从集电器上剥离，用纯DEC溶剂反复冲洗，然后在60℃真空干燥。 100°C 40分钟。立即将制备的阴极样品送去进行XRD测量。使用Mercury CSD 2.0中的材料模块分析了PTCDI晶体中分子排列的示意图。（23）

For quantitative determination of the Na contents in the cycled cathodes, the cathode samples disassembled from the coin cells at different charge/discharge depths was rinsed several times with pure EC solvent and then burned in a tubular furnace at 550 °C for 10 h. The as-obtained sodium oxide residue was dissolved in HCl for inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopic analysis (ICP) on a Thermo Fisher Scientific iCAP6300 spectrometer.  
为了定量测定循环阴极中的Na含量，用纯EC溶剂冲洗从硬币电池在不同充电/放电深度处分解的阴极样品数次，然后在550°C的管式炉中燃烧10 h。将获得的氧化钠残留物溶于HCl，以在Thermo Fisher Scientific iCAP6300光谱仪上进行电感耦合等离子体（ICP）光谱分析（ICP）。

## Results and Discussion
PTCDI and its derivatives have been extensively investigated as n-channel semiconductor for organic optoelectronic applications because of their high electron affinity and large electron mobility in the solid state.(24) However, the electrochemical property of PTCDI as an organic Na-storage cathode remains unrevealed until now. To evaluate its cathodic performance, we ball-milled the PTCDI powders with conductive carbon under Ar protection so as to downsize the active particles and to establish well-connected electronic channels for electrochemical reactions.  
PTCDI及其衍生物作为有机电子应用中的n通道半导体已被广泛研究，因为它们在固态中具有高电子亲和力和大的电子迁移率。（24）然而，PTCDI作为有机Na储存阴极的电化学性质仍然存在直到现在仍未公开。为评估其阴极性能，我们在Ar保护下将PTCDI粉末与导电碳进行球磨，以减小活性颗粒的尺寸并建立用于电化学反应的连接良好的电子通道。

The molecular structure of PTCDI was confirmed by FTIR spectrometry. As shown in Figure 1a, all the IR features can be assigned to the characteristic vibrations of perylene ring and imide groups of PTCDI structure. The absorption peaks at 3044, 2919, 2845, and 1588 cm–1 reflect the stretching vibrations of Ar(C–H) bonds and perylene ring, while the absorptions at 3154, 1687, 1361, and 1278 cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the N–H, C═O, and C–N bonds of imide groups, respectively. The IR pattern suggests that the PTCDI molecules kept their chemical structure untouched during ball-milling treatment. The particle morphology of the PTCDI sample was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As displayed in Figure 1b, the PTCDI sample appeared as irregularly shaped and unevenly sized powders with diameters ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) in Figure 1b (inset) shows a ring-like pattern with many intense spots, revealing a polycrystalline structure of the PTCDI powders. The XRD pattern of PTCDI is given in Figure 1c. Compared with previous crystallographic analysis of PTCDI derivatives,(24-26) the XRD peaks in Figure 1c can be assigned to the (011), (021), (002), (112̅), (122), and (140) planes of PTCDI crystal (monoclinic P21/n space group), respectively. The molecular arrangement in this PTCDI crystal is schematically shown in Figure 1d. The PTCDAs are planar-stacked in a herringbone packing with the unite cell parameters of a = 4.865 Å, b = 14.66 Å, c = 10.84 Å, and β = 91.33°. The detailed crystal parameters of PTCDI are given in Supporting Information (Table S1).  
通过FTIR光谱法证实了PTCDI的分子结构。如图1a所示，可以将所有IR特征分配给PTCDI结构的per环和酰亚胺基团的特征振动。在3044、2919、2845和1588 cm-1处的吸收峰反映了Ar（CH）键和per环的拉伸振动，而在3154、1687、1361和1278 cm-1处的吸收峰对应于拉伸酰亚胺基团的N–H，C = O和C–N键的振动。 IR图表明，PTCDI分子在球磨处理期间保持其化学结构不变。通过扫描电子显微镜（SEM）观察到PTCDI样品的颗粒形态。如图1b所示，PTCDI样品呈不规则形状和尺寸不均匀的粉末，直径范围为100 nm至1μm。图1b（插图）中的选定区域电子衍射（SAED）显示出具有许多强烈斑点的环状图案，从而揭示了PTCDI粉末的多晶结构。 PTCDI的XRD图在图1c中给出。与以前的PTCDI衍生物的晶体学分析相比，（24-26）图1c中的XRD峰可以指定为（011），（021），（002），（112̅），（122）和（140）平面分别为PTCDI晶体（单斜晶P21/n空间群）。该PTCDI晶体中的分子排列如图1d所示。 PTCDA平面堆叠在人字形填料中，单元参数为a = 4.865Å，b = 14.66Å，c = 10.84Å和β= 91.33°。 PTCDI的详细晶体参数在支持信息（表S1）中给出。

Electrochemical performances of the PTCDI cathode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements. Figure 2a shows the first two cycles of the CV curves of a PTCDI electrode in 1 mol L–1 NaPF6 + EC/DEC/PC electrolyte. During the first cathodic scan, only one large reduction peak appears at a more negative potential of 1.6 V, suggesting a large polarization needed for initial electrochemical insertion of Na+ ions into the uncoordinated PTCDI molecules. On the reversed anodic scan, two anodic peaks emerge at 2.30 and 2.80 V, respectively, corresponding to a two-stepped oxidation of [C24H10N2O4]2– → [C24H10N2O4]− → [C24H10N2O4]. Moreover, a small shoulder peak can also be observed at 2.62 V, probably due to a bond rearrangement of the PTCDI molecule at the positive potential. During subsequent cycles, these three pairs of redox peaks remained almost unchanged in their positions and intensities in the potential region of 3–1.5 V, implying a multiple electron transfer reaction and electrochemical reversibility of the cathodic reaction.  
PTCDI阴极的电化学性能通过循环伏安法（CV）和恒电流放电/电荷测量进行评估。图2a显示了在1 mol L–1 NaPF6 + EC /DEC /PC电解质中PTCDI电极的CV曲线的前两个循环。在第一次阴极扫描期间，在一个更大的负电位1.6 V处仅出现一个大的还原峰，表明将Na+离子初始电化学插入未配位的PTCDI分子所需的大极化。在反向阳极扫描中，分别在2.30和2.80 V出现两个阳极峰，对应于[C24H10N2O4] 2→[C24H10N2O4]→→[C24H10N2O4]的两步氧化。此外，还可能在2.62 V处观察到小的肩峰，这可能是由于PTCDI分子在正电势下的键重排所致。在随后的循环中，这三对氧化还原峰的位置和强度在3–1.5 V的电势区域中几乎保持不变，这意味着多重电子转移反应和阴极反应的电化学可逆性。

图2.（a）以1 mV s-1的扫描速率测量的PTCDI电极的CV曲线，以及（b）在10 mA g-1的恒定电流下的充电/放电曲线。

The charge/discharge profiles of the PTCDI electrode are in a close correspondence with its CV curves. As displayed in Figure 2b, there is only one voltage plateau at ∼1.7 V at first discharge of the PTCDI cathode, whereas there are three plateaus appearing at 2.0, 2.5, and 2.8 V during the first charge. Since the second cycle, the charge/discharge curves remained almost the same during successive cycles, confirming the electrochemical reversibility and cycling stability of the organic cathode. The first charge/discharge capacities of the PTCDI cathode are 150/140 mAh g–1, corresponding to an initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%, which is even higher than those of inorganic Na+-insertion cathodes. During subsequent cycles, the PTCDI cathode delivers stable charge/discharge capacities of 138.7/138.6 mAh g–1, which correspond to a 2-electron redox capacity per PTCDI molecule (137 mAh g–1). The slightly higher charge capacity (∼10 mAh g–1) at the first cycle is most likely due to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI film) on the PTCDI cathode. According to previous investigations of the redox mechanism of aromatic imides in Li+ electrolytes,(26-28) the charge/discharge reactions of imide compounds take place through an electrochemical enolization reaction of their carbonyl groups along with Li+ ions associating with and disassociating from the oxygen atoms of the imide groups. In light of this redox mechanism, the redox reaction of the PTCDI cathode could be analogously assigned to a reversible enolization process, in which the carbonyl groups of the imide structure undergo electron transfer reaction accompanied by the insertion and extraction of Na+ ions. In principle, each PTCDI molecule has four carbonyl groups, which should be able to transfer four electrons for reversible accommodation of 4 Na+ ions. However, like the most of aromatic imides reported for Na+ and Li+ storage applications,(14, 26-28) the PTCDI cathode can only realize a two-electron redox reaction at acceptably high potential of ≥1.5 V, possibly due to the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance in the PTCDI crystal. On the basis of the CV features and charge/discharge capacities, the redox mechanism of the PTCDI cathode could be described as a two-stepped enolization reaction with reversible insertion of 2 Na+ ions, as shown in Scheme 1.  
PTCDI电极的充电/放电曲线与其CV曲线非常接近。如图2b所示，在PTCDI阴极的首次放电时，电压约为1.7 V的平稳段，而在第一次充电时则分别在2.0、2.5和2.8 V处出现三个平稳段。自第二个循环以来，充电/放电曲线在连续的循环中几乎保持不变，从而确认了有机阴极的电化学可逆性和循环稳定性。 **PTCDI阴极的首次充放电容量为150/140 mAh g-1，对应的初始库仑效率为93.3％，甚至高于无机Na+插入阴极的库仑效率**。在随后的循环中，PTCDI阴极可提供138.7 /138.6 mAh g-1的稳定充电/放电容量，相当于每个PTCDI分子的2电子氧化还原容量（137 mAh g-1）。由于在PTCDI阴极上形成了固态电解质中间相（SEI膜），因此第一个循环的充电容量稍高（约10 mAh g-1）。根据先前对Li +电解质中芳族酰亚胺氧化还原机理的研究，（26-28）酰亚胺化合物的充电/放电反应是通过其羰基以及与氧缔合和解离的Li +离子的电化学烯醇化反应发生的酰亚胺基团的原子。根据这种氧化还原机理，可以将PTCDI阴极的氧化还原反应类似地分配给可逆的烯醇化过程，在该过程中，酰亚胺结构的羰基经历电子转移反应，并伴随着Na+离子的插入和萃取。原则上，每个PTCDI分子均具有四个羰基，这些羰基应能够转移四个电子以可逆地容纳4个Na+离子。但是，就像报道的大多数用于Na+和Li +储存应用的芳族酰亚胺一样，（14，26-28）**PTCDI阴极只能在可接受的高电势≥1.5V下实现两电子氧化还原反应，这可能是由于静电排斥和PTCDI晶体中的位阻**。根据CV特性和充电/放电容量，PTCDI阴极的氧化还原机理可以描述为两步式的烯化反应，可逆地插入2个Na+离子，如方案1所示。

Scheme 1. Schematic Representation of the Proposed Redox Mechanism for Reversible Na Storage Reaction of PTCDI
In addition to its 2 Na+ storage capacity, the PTCDI cathode can also demonstrate a remarkable rate capability. Figure 3a shows the reversible capacities of the PTCDI electrode measured at various current rates from 20 mA g–1 (1/6 C) to 600 mA g–1 (5 C). As the current rate increased from 20 mA g–1 to 300 mA g–1 (2.5 C), the reversible capacity decreased slightly from 138 mAh g–1 to 118 mAh g–1. Even at a very high rate of 600 mA g–1, the PTCDI electrode can still deliver a quite high capacity of 103 mAh g–1, which corresponds to a ∼75% capacity retention at such a high rate. When the current density was recovered to 200 mA g–1, the reversible capacity returned to 116 mA h–1, about 90% of its original value, demonstrating strong capacity retention of the PTCDI electrode. Such a high-rate performance is rarely seen for the most of organic electrode materials and is most likely due to the substantial electron mobility of the π-conjugated structure of PTCDI molecules and the large lamellar spacing of planar-stacked structure of PTCDI crystals, which facilitate electron transportation and Na+ insertion into (or deinsertion from) the PTCDI lattice for charge/discharge reactions.  
除具有2 Na+的存储容量外，PTCDI阴极还具有出色的倍率性能。图3a显示了在20 mA g-1（1/6 C）至600 mA g-1（5 C）各种电流速率下测得的PTCDI电极的可逆容量。随着电流速率从20 mA g-1增加到300 mA g-1（2.5 C），可逆容量从138 mAh g-1略微降低到118 mAh g-1。即使在600 mA g-1的极高速率下，PTCDI电极仍可以提供103 mAh g-1的极高容量，相当于在如此高的速率下约75％的容量保持率。当电流密度恢复到200 mA g-1时，可逆容量恢复到116 mA h-1，约为其原始值的90％，这表明PTCDI电极具有很强的容量保持能力。对于大多数有机电极材料而言，如此高的速率性能很少见，最有可能是由于PTCDI分子的π共轭结构具有显着的电子迁移率以及PTCDI晶体的平面堆叠结构具有较大的层状间距，因此促进电子传输和Na+插入PTCDI晶格（或从其中插入）以进行充电/放电反应。

The long-term cycling performance of the PTCDI cathode was evaluated by galvanostatic cycling at a moderate current of 100 mA g–1. As shown in Figure 3b, the reversible capacity of PTCDI electrode decreases very slightly from its initial value of 118.6 to 107 mAh g–1 after 300 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention ratio of 90%. Usually, organic cathode materials are difficult to maintain a long cycle life due to their structural instability at high oxidation potentials and easy dissolution in organic electrolytes. In contrast, the long-term cycling stability of PTCDI is really very impressive, possibly due to the larger π-conjugated structure and strong intermolecular H-bonding of PTCDI molecules, which ensure the structural stability of PTCDI skeletons during repeated charge/discharge cycling.  
PTCDI阴极的长期循环性能通过恒电流循环在100 mA g-1的中等电流下进行评估。如图3b所示，经过300次循环后，PTCDI电极的可逆容量从其初始值118.6降至107 mAh g-1很小，相当于90％的容量保持率。通常，由于有机阴极材料在高氧化电势下的结构不稳定性并且易于溶解在有机电解质中，因此难以维持较长的循环寿命。相反，PTCDI的长期循环稳定性确实非常令人印象深刻，这可能是由于PTCDI分子具有更大的π共轭结构和强大的分子间H键，从而确保了PTCDI骨架在反复充/放电循环过程中的结构稳定性。

To further confirm the Na+-storage reaction mechanism, the changes in the bonding state, lattice structure and Na content of the PTCDI crystal cycled at different charge/discharge depths were characterized by FTIR, XRD and ICP analysis. Figure 4b shows the changes in the IR signals of the PTCDI electrode at different charge/discharge states. When first discharged to 2.0 V, the characteristic IR peak of the C═O stretching (1687 cm–1) was widened and negatively shifted to 1623 cm–1, suggesting that electrons were transferred into the C═O bonds, leading to a weakening of the C═O bonds. Meanwhile, the absorption peak at 1345 cm–1 from the C–N stretching vibration increased its intensity, possibly because the electron transfer into the C═O bond would result in an increase in the dipole moment of adjacent C–N bond. When further discharged to 1.75 V, all the IR absorptions of perylene ring and imide C–N bond kept almost unchanged, while the C═O bond stretching at 1623 cm–1 was further shifted to 1619 cm–1, reflecting a continuous reduction of the C═O groups. As fully discharged to 1.0 V, the IR absorption of the C═O bond became much weaker but still detectable, which agrees well with expectation from the discharge mechanism, as displayed in Scheme 1, that half of the C═O bonds would be enolized to convert into Na+ enolate. As a result, the reduction of the C═O bonds leads to a decreased π-conjugation in the PTCDI structure, as reflected by a large shift of the perylene ring stretching vibration from 1588 to 1540 cm–1. On the reversed charge, all the IR bands of the C═O, C–N and perylene ring reversibly regain their original positions and intensities, exhibiting a reversible change in the bonding states of PTCDI during charge and discharge.  
为了进一步证实Na+储存反应机理，通过FTIR，XRD和ICP分析表征了在不同充放电深度循环的PTCDI晶体的键合状态，晶格结构和Na含量的变化。图4b显示了在不同的充电/放电状态下PTCDI电极的IR信号的变化。首次放电至2.0 V时，C═O拉伸的特征IR峰（1687 cm–1）变宽并且负移至1623 cm–1，这表明电子被转移到C═O键中，从而导致弱化C═O键。同时，从C–N拉伸振动开始的1345 cm–1处的吸收峰增加了强度，这可能是因为电子转移到C═O键中会导致相邻C–N键的偶极矩增加。当进一步放电至1.75 V时，per环和酰亚胺C–N键的所有IR吸收几乎保持不变，而在1623 cm–1处拉伸的C═O键进一步移至1619 cm–1，这反映了C═O组。完全放电至1.0 V时，C═O键的IR吸收变得很弱，但仍可检测到，这与放电机理的预期非常吻合，如方案1所示，一半的C═O键会被烯化转化为钠+烯醇结果，C═O键的减少导致PTCDI结构中π共轭的减少，这反映在the环拉伸振动从1588到1540 cm-1的大位移上。在反向充电中，C═O，C–N和per环的所有IR波段可逆地恢复其原始位置和强度，在充电和放电过程中PTCDI的键合状态呈现出可逆的变化。

In accord with the IR results, XRD analysis also reveals a reversible change of the PTCDI structure in the charge/discharge processes. As shown in Figure 4c, all the XRD peaks at 2θ = 10.15, 12.16, 25.08, 27.20, and 30.53° continuously decreased their intensities and finally disappeared with increasing depth of discharge, suggesting a structural breakdown of the PTCDI framework. Meanwhile, two new peaks at 2θ = 11.26 and 28.51° appeared and grew notably as the discharge proceeded. These phenomena suggest that the molecular arrangement pattern in the PTCDI crystal was changed when the Na+ ions were inserted and associated with the carbonyl groups, which altered the original monoclinic symmetry of the PTCDI crystal. Nevertheless, all the XRD peaks can recover their original positions and intensities after charging, indicating a structural rearrangement from the Na+-doped state to its pristine state. This reversible change of the XRD pattern further confirms the reversible phase transformation and structural stability of PTCDI in charge–discharge cycling.  
与IR结果一致，XRD分析还揭示了PTCDI结构在充电/放电过程中的可逆变化。如图4c所示，在2θ=10.15、12.16、25.08、27.20和30.53°处的所有XRD峰连续降低其强度，并随着放电深度的增加而最终消失，表明PTCDI骨架结构破裂。同时，随着放电的进行，出现了两个新的峰，分别位于2θ= 11.26和28.51°处，并显着增长。这些现象表明，当插入Na+离子并与羰基结合时，PTCDI晶体中的分子排列模式发生了变化，从而改变了PTCDI晶体的原始单斜对称性。然而，所有XRD峰在充电后都可以恢复其原始位置和强度，表明从Na+掺杂状态到其原始状态的结构重排。 XRD图案的可逆变化进一步证实了PTCDI在充放电循环中的可逆相变和结构稳定性。

ICP analysis of the Na+ contents in the PTCDI cathode at different charge/discharge depths provides a direct evidence for the proposed Na insertion/extraction mechanism in Scheme 1. As given in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the Na+ content in the PTCDI cathode increased from 0% at open circuit potential to 4.77 wt % at discharge potential of 2.0 V and finally to 10.48 wt % at discharge end potential of 1.0 V during discharge, which corresponds to the insertion of 1.98 Na+ ions into each PTCDI molecule after a full discharge. On the reversed charging process, the Na content decreased from 10.48 wt % in the fully sodiated PTCDI to 0.07% in the fully charged state, demonstrating an almost complete removal of Na+ ions from the discharged PTCDI cathode. This quantitative determination of Na+ content in the cycled cathode not only confirms the 2Na-insertion mechanism but also explains the very high charge/discharge efficiency of PTCDI material. Such a high Coulombic efficiency plays a critical role for the PTCDI cathode to achieve a long-term cycling stability.  
对不同充电/放电深度下PTCDI阴极中Na+含量的ICP分析提供了方案1中拟议的Na插入/萃取机理的直接证据。如表S1（支持信息）所示，PTCDI阴极中的Na+含量增加了从开路电势下的0％到2.0 V放电电势下的4.77 wt％，最后在放电过程中1.0 V的放电端电势下达到10.48 wt％，这相当于在完全放电后将1.98 Na+离子插入每个PTCDI分子。在反向充电过程中，Na含量从完全饱和的PTCDI中的10.48 wt％降低到完全充电的状态中的0.07％，表明从放电的PTCDI阴极几乎完全去除了Na+离子。循环阴极中Na+含量的这种定量测定不仅证实了2Na的插入机理，还解释了PTCDI材料的极高充电/放电效率。如此高的库仑效率对PTCDI阴极实现长期循环稳定性起着至关重要的作用。

## Conclusions
In summary, we selected a pristine perylene diimide, 3,4,9,10-perylene-bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI), as a model compound to examine its Na-storage property. Benefiting from its high density of cathode-active and Na+-associable carbonyl groups, the PTCDI molecule can undergo electrochemical enolization reaction with reversible insertion/extraction of 2 Na+ ions per molecular unit, delivering a redox capacity of 140 mAh g–1 at 20 mA g–1 (1/6 C). In addition, this organic cathode also demonstrates a strong rate capability with a reversible capacity of 103 mAh g–1 at 600 mA g–1 (5 C) and a stable cyclability with 90% capacity retention over 300 cycles. Particularly, this PTCDI material is commercially available, low-cost, and nontoxic, and thus, it may serve as a new alternative cathode for Na-ion battery applications.
