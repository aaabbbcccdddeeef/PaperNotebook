### Main
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) indeed represent the state-of-the-art battery systems,1,2 but developing sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have recently captured much research interest because of the natural abundance and the low cost of sodium.3–5 So far, the investigation of electrode materials for SIBs is mainly focused on transition-metal inorganic compounds6–8 or alloy-based materials,9–11 which are synthesized from limited resources and thus give rise to the problem of cost and availability concerns. In contrast, organic materials without expensive elements are potential low cost and sustainable electrodes.12–16 In this regard, various electrochemical dopable polymers have been studied for SIBs and gained recent achievements.17,18 The energy density of these materials is limited by doping levels as well as the anion–cation doping–de-doping mechanism which requires a large excess of electrolytes.19 Meanwhile, organic carbonyl compounds are also attractive electrodes because of their processability, redox stability, structural diversity, and high theoretical capacities.20–23 Like in LIBs, most organic carbonyl compounds are designed for cathode application, such as Na2C6O6,24 indigo carmine,25 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylicacid-dianhydride (PTCDA),26 and a series of dianhydride-based polyimides.27 In comparison, only a few organic carbonyl compounds are suitable candidates for anode materials.28 For example, sodium terephthalate and its derivatives have been proposed as anodes for SIBs,29–31 showing cycle life up to 100 cycles with reversible capacity in the range of 170–300 mA h g−1. More recently, the sodiation–desodiation behaviour of a graphene oxide wrapped croconic acid disodium salt has also been tested.32 It rendered an initial capacity of ∼290 mA h g−1 with ∼45% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g−1. Therefore, exploiting new carbonyl compound anode material is still needed.  
锂离子电池（LIB）确实代表了最先进的电池系统，1,2，但由于钠的自然丰度和低成本，最近开发的钠离子电池（SIB）引起了很多研究兴趣。3– 5到目前为止，用于SIB的电极材料的研究主要集中在过渡金属无机化合物6-8或合金基材料9-11上，这些材料是由有限的资源合成的，因此引起了成本和可用性问题。相反，不含昂贵元素的有机材料是潜在的低成本且可持续的电极。12–16在这方面，已针对SIB研究了各种电化学可掺杂聚合物，并取得了最新成果。17,18这些材料的能量密度受到掺杂的限制。的水平以及需要大量过量电解质的阴离子-阳离子掺杂-去掺杂机理。19同时，有机羰基化合物由于其可加工性，氧化还原稳定性，结构多样性和较高的理论容量，也是有吸引力的电极。20– 23像在LIB中一样，大多数有机羰基化合物都设计用于阴极应用，例如Na2C6O6,24靛蓝胭脂红，25 3,4,9,10-tetra-四羧酸-二酐（PTCDA），26和一系列基于二酐的聚酰亚胺.27相比之下，只有少数几种有机羰基化合物适合用作阳极材料。28例如，对苯二甲酸钠及其衍生物已被提议作为阳极材料。SIB的电极29-31显示了高达100个循环的循环寿命，可逆容量在170-300 mA h g-1的范围内。最近，还测试了氧化石墨烯包裹的月桂酸二钠盐的钠盐-钠盐脱盐行为[32]。在电流密度为20的情况下，经过100次循环后，其初始容量为〜290 mA hg-1，保持了约45％的容量。 mA g-1。因此，仍然需要开发新的羰基化合物阳极材料。

In 2008, a dilithiated 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Li2DBQ) based coordination polymer was reported as cathode material for LIBs with an average potential of ∼1.65 V (vs. Li+/Li).33 As the redox potential of Na/Na+ (−2.71 V vs. SHE) is higher than that of Li analogues (−3.04 V vs. SHE), the sodium derivative Na2DBQ should possess lower operation potential (vs. Na/Na+), which might make it a suitable anode for SIBs. Moreover, it could also offer good stability due to its highly ionic nature.13 Herein, we firstly reported the application of Na2DBQ as an electrode for SIBs. The as-prepared Na2DBQ exhibits high reversible capacity (265 mA h g−1) with an average storage voltage of ∼1.2 V (vs. Na+/Na). Furthermore, Na2DBQ also demonstrates high cyclability up to 300 cycles and high rate capability up to 5 C, rendering it a promising anode for SIBs.  
2008年，据报道，基于二锂化的2,5-二羟基-1,4-苯醌（Li2DBQ）作为LIB的阴极材料，平均电势约为1.65 V（vs.Li + /Li）.33作为氧化还原电势Na /Na +（-2.71 V vs. SHE）的电势比Li类似物（-3.04 V vs. SHE）的高，**钠衍生物Na2DBQ应具有较低的工作电势（vs. Na /Na +），这可能使其成为适用于SIB的阳极**。此外，由于其高度的离子性质，它还可以提供良好的稳定性。13在此，我们首先报道了Na2DBQ作为SIBs电极的应用。所制备的Na2DBQ具有高可逆容量（265 mA h g-1），平均存储电压约为1.2 V（vs. Na + /Na）。此外，Na2DBQ还显示出高达300个循环的高循环能力和高达5 C的高倍率能力，使其成为SIB的有希望的阳极。

Na2DBQ was synthesized through a simple one-pot reaction of H2DBQ with sodium methylate in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution (left part of Scheme 1, see details in the ESI†). The raw material of H2DBQ is commercial available. The products were characterized by NMR (Fig. S1, ESI†), FTIR (Fig. S2, ESI†), and elemental analysis, all confirming the successful synthesis of the target Na2DBQ.  
Na2DBQ是通过H2DBQ与甲醇钠在二甲基亚砜（DMSO）溶液中的简单一锅反应而合成的（流程1的左半部分，请参见ESI†中的详细信息）。H2DBQ的原料可商购。通过NMR（图S1，ESI†），FTIR（图S2，ESI†）和元素分析对产物进行表征，所有这些都证实了目标Na2DBQ的成功合成。

The resulting Na2DBQ is in the form of dull red powder and exhibits irregular morphology with an average size in the submicron range as observed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. 1a). The BET specific surface area of Na2DBQ was 27.2 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†), which is favorable for the electrode–electrolyte contact. Also, the small particle size could shorten the ion diffusion path and thus help to achieve high rate performance. In addition, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of Na2DBQ demonstrates that no obvious mass loss is observed up to around 255 °C (Fig. 1b). Thermal stability is acceptable for practical application concerning the safety issue.34  
生成的Na2DBQ呈暗红色粉末形式，表现出不规则的形态，其平均大小在扫描电子显微镜（SEM）图像中观察到（亚微米级）（图1a）。 Na2DBQ的BET比表面积为27.2 m2 g-1（图S3，ESI†），有利于电极与电解质的接触。同样，小粒径可以缩短离子扩散路径，从而有助于实现高倍率性能。此外，Na2DBQ的热重分析（TG）表明，在大约255°C的温度下，未观察到明显的质量损失（图1b）。热稳定性对于涉及安全问题的实际应用是可以接受的34。

Na2DBQ contains two carbonyl groups as redox centers and can afford a high theoretical capacity of 291 mA h g−1 through reversible uptake of two sodium ions per formula unit (right part of Scheme 1). On the other hand, because of the ionic nature of Na2DBQ, the dissolution issue of low molecular organic compounds is expected to be restrained.35 To prove this concept, the electrochemical performance of Na2DBQ was evaluated using CR2032 coin-type half cells with sodium foil as a counter electrode. The working electrodes consist of Na2DBQ (60 wt%), conductive carbon (30 wt%), and the PVdF binder (10 wt%). The mass loading of the active material on the electrode is about 1.2 mg cm−2. The thickness of the electrode is about 20 μm (Fig. S4, ESI†). The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1 by volume). Glass fiber was used as an electrolyte. The cell was cycled in the voltage window of 0.5–2.5 V. The specific capacity values are calculated on the basis of the mass of the active materials.  
Na2DBQ包含两个羰基作为氧化还原中心，通过每个配方单元可逆地吸收两个钠离子，可以提供291 mA h g-1的高理论容量（方案1的右侧）。另一方面，由于Na2DBQ的离子性质，有望抑制低分子有机化合物的溶出问题。35为了证明这一概念，使用CR2032纽扣型钠箔半电池评估了Na2DBQ的电化学性能。作为对电极。**工作电极由Na2DBQ（60 wt％），导电碳（30 wt％）和PVdF粘合剂（10 wt％）组成**。电极上活性物质的质量负载约为1.2 mg cm-2。电极的厚度约为20μm（图S4，ESI†）。电解质是碳酸亚乙酯（EC）和碳酸二甲酯（DMC）（体积比为1：1）的混合物中的1 M NaClO4。玻璃纤维用作电解质。电池在0.5–2.5 V的电压窗口中循环。比容量值是根据活性物质的质量计算得出的。

Fig. 2a shows the initial three discharge–charge profiles of the assembled cell at a 0.1 C rate (1 C = 291 mA h g−1). The first discharge curve exhibits a long plateau at about 1.22 V, giving an initial discharge capacity of 398 mA h g−1. However, only 67% of the capacity is reversible. Meanwhile, the discharge curves changed significantly in the following cycle, showing two plateaus at ∼1.28 and ∼1.20 V, respectively. This is indicative of an activation process associated with the large volume expansion during the first sodiation. Such a phenomenon shows the results of some organic electrodes with large volume changes such as croconic acid.32 The two discharge plateaus in the subsequent cycles should correspond to a two-step 2e− reduction reaction of the quinonoid carbonyl groups, accompanied by the insertion of Na+ into Na2DBQ. Moreover, these two processes are reversible in the charge process. Two distinct plateaus located at 1.28 and 1.59 V can be clearly seen in the charge curves. The shape of the voltage profiles remained nearly unchanged after the first cycle, demonstrating good redox reversibility. The reversible reaction is further confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Note that the capacity of the second cycle reaches 265 mA h g−1, which is comparable with previous proposed carbonyl-based anode materials.29–32 Furthermore, the Na2DBQ electrode can offer satisfactory cycle performance. The capacity remained at 231 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Thus, the capacity retention reaches 87% from the second cycle to the fiftieth cycle. The good cycle stability is benefited from the increased polarities through salt formation which can effectively suppress dissolution.13 Additionally, the coulombic efficiency quickly increased to 99% after initial few cycles, even though it was relatively low at the first cycle. It should be pointed out that a very recent work demonstrated that polymerization of an organic salt could completely prevent the active material from dissolving.23 It is believed that this strategy should also be very useful for further increasing the cycling stability of Na2DBQ.  
图2a显示了组装电池在0.1 C速率（1 C = 291 mA h g-1）下的最初三个放电-充电曲线。第一放电曲线在约1.22 V处表现出较长的平稳期，初始放电容量为398 mA h g-1。但是，只有67％的容量是可逆的。同时，放电曲线在随后的周期中发生了显着变化，分别在〜1.28和〜1.20 V处出现两个平稳状态。这表明在第一次发酵期间与大量膨胀相关的活化过程。这种现象表明了一些有机电极的结果，例如crocroicic acid，具有较大的体积变化。32在随后的循环中，两个放电平台应对应于醌型羰基的两步2e-还原反应，并伴随着将Na +转化为Na2DBQ。而且，这两个过程在充电过程中是可逆的。在充电曲线中可以清楚地看到位于1.28和1.59 V的两个不同的平稳段。在第一个周期后，电压曲线的形状几乎保持不变，表明良好的氧化还原可逆性。可逆反应通过循环伏安法进一步证实，如图S5（ESI†）所示。请注意，第二个循环的容量达到265 mA h g-1，与先前提议的基于羰基的负极材料相当。29-32此外，Na2DBQ电极可提供令人满意的循环性能。 50次循环后，容量保持在231 mA h g-1。因此，从第二周期到第五十周期，容量保持率达到87％。良好的循环稳定性得益于形成盐的极性增加，可以有效抑制溶解。13此外，库伦效率在最初的几个循环后迅速提高到99％，即使在第一个循环中相对较低。应该指出的是，最近的一项工作表明有机盐的聚合可以完全防止活性物质溶解。23人们认为，该策略对于进一步提高Na2DBQ的循环稳定性也非常有用。

The rate performance of Na2DBQ was also investigated. Fig. 3a presents the typical discharge and charge profiles of Na2DBQ at various current densities. At a 0.1 C rate, the obtained capacity reaches 265 mA h g−1. When the current density became 10 times higher (1 C), a specific capacity of 248 mA h g−1 can still be achieved with small polarization. Even at a rate of 5 C, 60% of the capacity delivered at 0.1 C can be realized. The good rate capability should be ascribed to the large surface area and short ion diffusion length provided by the small Na2DBQ particles. Furthermore, organic molecules usually possess less rigid crystal structure compared to inorganic compounds, thus favoring Na+ insertion–deinsertion.30 As a result, Na2DBQ can operate at high current density for long-term cycling. As shown in Fig. 3b, after the first activation process, Na2DBQ can preserve 81% of the capacity from the 2nd cycle (236 mA h g−1) to the 100th cycle (192 mA h g−1). Remarkably, the capacity can remain at 181 mA h g−1 even after 300 cycles.  
还研究了Na2DBQ的速率性能。图3a展示了各种电流密度下Na2DBQ的典型放电和电荷分布。在0.1 C的速率下，获得的容量达到265 mA h g-1。当电流密度提高10倍（1 C）时，仍可在较小极化的情况下实现248 mA h g-1的比容量。即使在5 C的速率下，也可以实现在0.1 C时输送的容量的60％。优良的速率能力应归因于小的Na2DBQ颗粒提供的大表面积和短的离子扩散长度。此外，**与无机化合物相比，有机分子通常具有较少的刚性晶体结构，因此有利于Na +插入-插入**。30因此，Na2DBQ可以在高电流密度下工作以进行长期循环。如图3b所示，在第一次激活过程之后，Na2DBQ可以保留从第二个循环（236 mA h g-1）到第100个循环（192 mA h g-1）的容量的81％。值得注意的是，即使经过300次循环，容量仍可保持在181 mA h g-1。

Na2DBQ in addition to exhibiting relatively high voltage as anode material, which would result in low energy density in full cells, shows high capacity, good cyclability and high rate capability. It should be pointed out that no extra treatment such as surface modification29,32 is needed to gain the present electrode performance. More importantly, Na2DBQ possesses advantages of low cost, renewability, and environmentally-benign synthesis. Therefore, Na2DBQ holds promise as anode material for SIBs.  
Na2DBQ除了表现出相对较高的电压作为阳极材料外，还会导致全电池的能量密度较低，还具有高容量，良好的循环性和高倍率性能。应该指出的是，不需要额外的处理，例如表面改性29，32，就可以获得当前的电极性能。更重要的是，Na2DBQ具有低成本，可更新性和对环境无害的合成等优点。因此，Na2DBQ有望成为SIB的阳极材料。

In summary, the disodium salt of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone was prepared through a simple one-pot solution method using commercial available raw materials and found to be suitable as anode material for SIBs for the first time. Without any modification, Na2DBQ can operate at an average discharge voltage of ∼1.2 V with good electrochemical performance, including high capacity (∼265 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), a long cycle life (up to 300 cycles at 1 C), and high rate capability (160 mA h g−1 at a 5 C rate). These results shed light on the application of organic carbonyl compounds as electrode materials for SIBs.  
总之，使用市售原料通过简单的一锅法制备2，5-二羟基-1,4-苯醌二钠盐，发现它首次适合作为SIB的阳极材料。未经任何修改，Na2DBQ可以在约1.2 V的平均放电电压下工作，并具有良好的电化学性能，包括高容量（0.1 C时约为265 mA hg-1），长寿命（1 C时最多300个循环），和高速率能力（在5 C速率下为160 mA hg-1）。这些结果揭示了有机羰基化合物作为SIBs电极材料的应用。
